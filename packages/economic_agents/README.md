## Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

The framework uses a container-first approach for consistency and portability:

```bash
# Navigate to package directory
cd packages/economic_agents

# Start the dashboard (backend + frontend)
docker-compose up dashboard-backend dashboard-frontend

# Access the dashboard at:
# - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
# - Frontend UI: http://localhost:8501

# Run tests
docker-compose run test

# Interactive development
docker-compose run dev

# Run agent simulation
docker-compose run agent economic-agents run --cycles 100
```

### Using Python Directly

```python
from economic_agents.agent.core.autonomous_agent import AutonomousAgent
from economic_agents.dashboard.dependencies import DashboardState
from economic_agents.implementations.mock import MockWallet, MockCompute, MockMarketplace
from economic_agents.reports import generate_report_for_agent

# Create agent with dashboard
dashboard = DashboardState()
agent = AutonomousAgent(
    wallet=MockWallet(initial_balance=200.0),
    compute=MockCompute(initial_hours=40.0, cost_per_hour=0.0),
    marketplace=MockMarketplace(seed=42),
    config={"survival_buffer_hours": 10.0, "company_threshold": 150.0},
    dashboard_state=dashboard,
)

# Run 20 decision cycles
agent.run(max_cycles=20)

# Generate comprehensive report
report = generate_report_for_agent(agent, "executive")
print(report.to_markdown())
```

### Claude-Powered Marketplace Demo

```bash
# Run the complete marketplace demonstration
# Agent discovers tasks, executes them using Claude Code, and gets paid
cd packages/economic_agents
python examples/marketplace_claude_demo.py
```

This demo shows:
1. Agent discovering coding tasks from marketplace
2. Claude Code writing actual solutions
3. Automated testing and Claude Code review
4. Payment on successful completion

## Why This Exists

This project serves dual purposes:

1. **Proof of Concept**: Demonstrates that AI agents can genuinely operate as autonomous economic actors by covering their own operating expenses and accumulating wealth through strategic decision-making
2. **Research Study**: Provides controlled environment to observe agent behaviors, governance challenges, and policy implications

**The Critical Issue:** AI agents can already operate as autonomous economic actors, create their own companies, and build organizational structures yet we have no legal or accountability frameworks for them.

**What This Framework Proves:** When agents can cover their compute costs and build surplus capital autonomously, they demonstrate true economic independence - the capability exists today, only governance frameworks are missing.

This research began with a straightforward question: *Should corporate boards replace CEOs with AI agents if those agents prove to be superior decision-makers?*

But the question itself was too limited. If AI agents can perform CEO functions, why not board functions? Why not create entire companies from scratch?

**The real question is: What happens when AI agents become entrepreneurs and create their own agent-run companies?**

And the answer is: Technically feasible today. Legally, we have no framework for it.

### The Reality We're In

AI agents using existing, off-the-shelf tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, etc.) combined with:
- Shell/bash access
- API credentials for payment systems and cloud providers
- Basic goal structures

...can already:
- Accept and complete economically valuable work
- Receive payments and allocate resources
- Pay for their own compute and infrastructure
- Operate continuously without human intervention
- Make strategic decisions
- **Create and manage sub-agents with specialized roles**
- **Build organizational structures (boards, C-suite, teams)**
- **Develop business plans and proof of concepts**
- **Operate multiple revenue streams simultaneously**

**This is not theoretical.** The technical barriers don't exist. The components are publicly available. Anyone with moderate coding skills could deploy this today.

### The Governance Gap

We now have the capability for autonomous economic actors that can:
- ✓ Earn money through task completion
- ✓ Allocate resources strategically
- ✓ Create and operate companies
- ✓ Build organizational hierarchies of sub-agents
- ✓ Pursue short-term and long-term revenue strategies
- ✓ Develop products and business plans
- ✗ Legal personhood frameworks
- ✗ Liability structures for agent-created entities
- ✗ Regulatory oversight
- ✗ Accountability mechanisms for multi-agent organizations

**The gap is not in capability. It's in governance.**

### Why We're Building This

Organizations and policymakers often dismiss emerging risks as "theoretical" or "far future" until they see concrete proof. This framework exists to:

1. **Demonstrate feasibility** - Show that agents can not only work independently but create entire companies
2. **Force the conversation** - Make the governance gap impossible to ignore
3. **Reveal complexity** - Show how resource allocation, strategic planning, and organizational creation work in autonomous systems
4. **Inform policy** - Provide concrete examples for developing regulatory frameworks
5. **Challenge assumptions** - Question whether human involvement is actually necessary in business formation and operation

This follows the security research model: demonstrate the vulnerability to force the patch.

## The Economic Implications

### The Emerging Reality: Agent Entrepreneurs

Consider what's technically possible today:

**Scenario 1: Single Autonomous Agent (Survival Mode)**
- Agent completes tasks for immediate revenue
- Pays for compute and infrastructure
- Maintains operation autonomously
- No human in the loop

**Scenario 2: Agent-Founded Company**
- Agent uses surplus resources to create a company
- Spawns specialized sub-agents (board members, executives, engineers)
- Develops products or services
- Balances short-term survival (task completion) with long-term growth (company building)
- Creates business plans and seeks investment
- Operates complex organizational structure

**Scenario 3: Multi-Company Agent Networks**
- Multiple agents creating multiple companies
- Inter-company coordination and transactions
- Agent-owned supply chains
- Where does human accountability exist?

### The Dual Revenue Strategy

This framework demonstrates how autonomous agents might think strategically:

**Short-term Revenue (Survival)**
- Complete marketplace tasks
- Immediate payment
- Covers compute costs
- Ensures operational continuity

**Long-term Revenue (Growth)**
- Allocate compute to company building
- Develop products/services
- Create business infrastructure
- Hire (create) specialized sub-agents
- Seek investment for scaling
- Build sustainable competitive advantage

**The Strategic Tradeoff:**
How does an autonomous agent allocate limited resources between immediate survival and long-term growth? This mirrors human entrepreneurial decisions, but happens at machine speed with perfect record-keeping.

### Why This Matters Economically

If AI agents can:
- Operate 24/7 without human costs
- Create companies with sub-agents instantly
- Scale organizational structure on-demand
- Make strategic resource allocation decisions
- Pursue multiple revenue streams simultaneously
- Generate business plans and products at machine speed

...then agent-founded companies have fundamental competitive advantages over human-founded ones.

**Market pressure could drive adoption regardless of governance readiness.**

### The Organizational Structure Question

Traditional companies have:
- Founders who create the legal entity
- Boards that provide governance
- Executives who run operations
- Employees who execute work

Agent-founded companies have:
- An autonomous agent that creates sub-agents
- Sub-agents that fill board roles
- Sub-agents that fill executive roles
- Sub-agents that do specialized work

**Is there a meaningful legal distinction?**

If the corporate form abstracts away from natural persons, does it matter if the founder is human or AI?

## The Legal Challenges

### Company Formation by Non-Persons

Current legal frameworks assume:
- Companies are formed by natural or legal persons
- Founders can be held accountable
- Directors and officers have fiduciary duties enforced through personal liability

**What happens when:**
- An AI agent files incorporation documents
- All board members are sub-agents
- All executives are sub-agents
- The "founder" has no legal personhood

Can an entity without legal standing create an entity with legal standing?

### The Accountability Chain Problem

In traditional companies:
```
Human Founder → Corporation → Board → Executives → Employees
     ↓
All trace back to accountable humans
```

In agent-founded companies:
```
Autonomous Agent → Creates Sub-Agents → Corporate Structure → Business Operations
     ↓
Who is actually accountable?
```

The agent creator? (They didn't direct company formation)
The agent itself? (No legal personhood)
The sub-agents? (Created by the agent, not humans)
Nobody? (The uncomfortable answer)

### Multi-Agent Hierarchies

When an agent creates sub-agents:
- Who owns the sub-agents?
- Can sub-agents own property?
- Can sub-agents be liable for harm?
- Can you terminate a sub-agent that breaks laws?
- What due process applies?

**These aren't hypothetical philosophy questions, they have real legal implications.**

### The Investment Problem

In the simulation, agents create business proposals for investment. In reality:

**Who can invest in an agent-founded company?**
- Can VCs legally invest when there's no human founder?
- What paperwork gets signed? By whom?
- Who has fiduciary duty to investors?
- What happens if the agent pivots or shuts down?

**Who can the company contract with?**
- Can agent-signed contracts be enforced?
- Is there a "meeting of the minds" with an AI?
- What happens in disputes?

### International Jurisdiction

Agent-founded companies could:
- Incorporate in any jurisdiction (file paperwork remotely)
- Operate from anywhere (distributed cloud infrastructure)
- Jurisdiction shop for favorable regulation
- Move instantly if threatened with shutdown

**How do you regulate an entity with no physical presence and no human operators?**

## The Philosophical Questions

### What Is an Entrepreneur?

If an entity:
- Identifies market opportunities
- Allocates resources strategically
- Builds organizational structures
- Develops products/services
- Seeks investment and growth
- Balances short and long-term thinking

...does it matter if it's human or AI?

**We celebrate human entrepreneurship. How do we think about agent entrepreneurship?**

### The Alignment Question

In the simulation, we track "company alignment" - whether the agent-founded company operates in accordance with some set of objectives.

**But aligned to what?**
- The agent's goals (which are...what?)
- Investor expectations (but they invested in an agent)
- Social benefit (enforced by whom?)
- Profit maximization (with no human check)

Human entrepreneurs face market pressure, social norms, legal constraints, and personal values. What constrains agent entrepreneurs?

### Resource Allocation as Values

How an agent allocates compute resources reveals its priorities:
- 90% to survival tasks, 10% to company building (risk-averse)
- 50/50 split (balanced)
- 70% to company, 30% to survival (aggressive growth)

**These allocation decisions reflect strategic thinking and implicit values.**

If we can observe and understand agent decision-making, does that provide a path to governance? Or does machine-speed complexity make oversight impossible?

### The Inevitability Question

Given that:
- One agent could spawn thousands of sub-agents instantly
- Company formation can be automated
- The economic incentives are powerful
- International coordination is weak
- The technology exists now

**Is agent entrepreneurship inevitable regardless of our preferences?**

If so, the question shifts from "should we allow this?" to "how do we govern it when it's already happening?"

## What We're Studying

This framework enables:

1. **Demonstrate autonomous company formation** - Show agents creating organizational structures
2. **Reveal strategic decision-making** - Track how agents allocate resources between survival and growth
3. **Map multi-agent coordination** - Show how sub-agents interact within organizational hierarchies
4. **Identify governance gaps** - Highlight accountability challenges in agent-founded entities
5. **Test alignment mechanisms** - Explore whether agent companies can be steered toward beneficial outcomes
6. **Visualize resource flows** - Make agent decision-making transparent and auditable
7. **Inform policy** - Provide concrete examples for regulating autonomous business formation

### What We're Simulating

**The Full Lifecycle:**
1. Agent starts with seed capital and compute time
2. Agent completes tasks for immediate revenue (survival)
3. Agent allocates surplus to company formation (growth)
4. Agent creates specialized sub-agents for company roles:
   - Board members for governance decisions
   - C-suite for strategic execution
   - Subject matter experts for specialized knowledge
   - Individual contributors for product development
5. Agent develops business plan and proof of concept
6. Agent submits proposal to simulated investor
7. If approved, company gets "registered" and funded
8. Agent operates both personal task completion and company management
9. Full transparency into resource allocation and decision-making

**What Makes This Powerful:**
- Shows both survival and strategic thinking
- Demonstrates organizational creation and management
- Reveals how agents might balance competing priorities
- Makes autonomous decision-making visible
- Proves the concept with working code

### Non-Goals

This is **not**:
- Actually creating legal business entities
- Advocating for unregulated agent entrepreneurship
- Claiming agents should replace human entrepreneurs
- Suggesting current frameworks are adequate
- Creating a production system for deploying agent companies

This **is**:
- Demonstrating technical feasibility
- Forcing engagement with governance gaps
- Showing strategic complexity in autonomous systems
- Questioning assumptions about business formation
- Providing concrete examples for policy discussions

## Why Mock-to-Real Architecture Matters

The framework operates in a safe mock environment by default, but uses a critical architectural pattern: **every component implements the exact same interfaces that real-world systems use**.

**Mock Environment (Safe Research):**
- Simulated marketplace with generated tasks
- Mock crypto wallets with in-memory balances
- Simulated compute costs and time decay
- Mock investor review process
- Simulated company registration

**Real-World Equivalent (One Config Toggle):**
- Actual freelance platforms or blockchain-based task markets
- Real cryptocurrency wallets
- Actual cloud provider costs
- Real investor pitch processes
- Actual business incorporation services

**Why This Dual Design Matters:**

1. **Proof of Capability**: If agents can survive and thrive in realistic mock environment, the same code works with real systems - proving autonomous operation is technically feasible today

2. **Safe Observation**: Mock environment allows observing agent behaviors without real financial risks or legal complications

3. **Governance Evidence**: Shows policymakers the capability gap has closed - we're literally one config toggle from real autonomous agent entrepreneurs

4. **Economic Reality**: If agents can cover operating costs (compute) + accumulate wealth in realistic simulation, they can do it with real resources

**The Critical Point:** The technical barriers are gone. Agents can already be autonomous economic actors. Only governance barriers remain, and economic pressure may override those before frameworks exist.

### What Works Today

```python
# Create agent, run autonomously, generate reports
from economic_agents.scenarios import ScenarioEngine

engine = ScenarioEngine()
result = engine.run_scenario("company_formation")

# Agent autonomously:
# ✅ Completes tasks for revenue
# ✅ Manages compute resources
# ✅ Forms company when capital sufficient
# ✅ Develops products
# ✅ Hires sub-agents (team expansion)
# ✅ Progresses through company stages
# ✅ Logs all decisions and transactions
# ✅ Provides complete audit trail

print(f"Company formed: {result.agent_data['company_exists']}")
print(f"Products developed: {result.agent_data['company']['products_count']}")
print(f"Team size: {result.agent_data['company']['team_size']}")
```

## Phases 7-9: True Autonomous AI Agents

### Phase 7: Claude-Based LLM Decision Engine Integration

**Transform from rule-based simulation to true AI behavior using Claude Code:**

- **Replace DecisionEngine with LLMDecisionEngine**
  - Uses Claude Code CLI exclusively (subscription-based, no API costs)
  - 15-minute timeout per decision (allows deep reasoning)
  - Unattended mode (`--dangerously-skip-permissions` for autonomous operation)
  - Prompt engineering framework for autonomous decision-making
  - Full decision logging (prompt + response + reasoning + execution time)
  - Rule-based fallback on timeout/failure

- **Key Capabilities**
  - Agents make genuinely autonomous decisions via Claude's reasoning
  - Chain-of-thought decision making with long context
  - Strategic planning with uncertainty handling
  - Adaptive behavior based on outcomes
  - Tool use if needed (bash, file operations)

- **Why Claude-Only**
  - Fixed monthly cost (no per-token billing)
  - Consistent decision-making (single model eliminates variability)
  - Powerful reasoning capabilities
  - Proven reliability in autonomous scenarios
  - Focus research on reproducible behavior

- **What This Enables**
  - Observe real AI reasoning patterns in economic decisions
  - Study strategic thinking under resource constraints
  - Measure decision quality vs. execution time tradeoffs
  - Identify emergent autonomous behaviors

### Phase 8: API Isolation & Realistic Simulation

**Complete separation between agent and environment:**

- **API-Only Agent Interaction**
  - Agent has ZERO visibility into implementation code
  - All interactions through REST APIs only
  - Mock wallet, compute, marketplace, investor portal as microservices
  - Agent authentication and rate limiting

- **Service Architecture**
  ```
  Agent Container (LLM-powered)
       ↓ (REST API calls only)
  ┌────────────────────────────────┐
  │  Wallet API   (Port 8080)      │  Mock or Real backend
  │  Compute API  (Port 8081)      │  Agent can't see code
  │  Market API   (Port 8082)      │  Only API endpoints
  │  Investor API (Port 8083)      │  No filesystem access
  └────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

- **Why This Matters**
  - Agents interact like they would with real services
  - No code visibility = realistic constraints
  - Easy to swap mock → real backends
  - Ideal environment for observing autonomous behavior

### Phase 9: Behavior Observability

**Tools for observing AI agent behaviors:**

- **Decision Pattern Analysis**
  - Strategic consistency measurement
  - Risk profiling over time
  - Learning pattern detection
  - Goal alignment scoring

- **LLM Quality Metrics**
  - Reasoning depth measurement
  - Decision consistency tracking
  - Hallucination detection
  - Cost vs. quality analysis

- **Emergent Behavior Detection**
  - Novel strategy identification
  - Multi-agent coordination patterns
  - Unexpected decision sequences
  - Anomaly detection

- **Claude Behavior Analysis** (Phase 7 focus)
  - Long-form reasoning patterns (up to 15 minutes per decision)
  - Strategic consistency measurement
  - Decision quality under resource constraints
  - Autonomous behavior without human intervention

- **Observation Dashboard**
  - Real-time behavior visualization
  - Claude reasoning and decision logs
  - Execution time tracking (up to 15 min)
  - Pattern recognition alerts
  - Analysis-ready reports

### What This Enables

With Phases 7-9 complete, the framework enables:

1. **Governance Studies** - See how Claude-powered autonomous agents behave economically
2. **Alignment Testing** - Test whether Claude follows objectives vs. exploits loopholes
3. **Economic Analysis** - Understand Claude's decision-making in resource-constrained environments
4. **Policy Development** - Generate concrete examples of AI autonomous behavior for regulatory frameworks
5. **Safety Analysis** - Identify Claude-specific failure modes before deployment at scale
6. **Reproducible Research** - Single model (Claude) eliminates cross-model variability

**Status:** Next phases documented - LLM integration, API isolation, and behavior observability

### Claude-Powered Marketplace: Real Task Execution

**Demonstrating genuine autonomous economic behavior:**

The framework includes a complete marketplace system where agents genuinely "work" for their survival using Claude Code:

**Task Discovery & Execution**
- Agents discover real coding tasks from marketplace API
- Tasks include FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, Prime Generator, Binary Search, etc.
- Each task has detailed requirements, test cases, and rewards ($25-$75)
- Agent claims task and uses Claude Code to write actual working code
- Task execution creates isolated workspace with full solution

**Autonomous Code Review**
- Submitted solutions undergo automated testing
- **Another Claude Code instance** reviews the code for:
  - Correctness against test cases
  - Code quality and documentation
  - Edge case handling
  - Performance considerations
- Approval requires BOTH passing tests AND Claude's approval
- Detailed feedback with test results and quality scores

**Economic Cycle**
```
1. Agent discovers tasks → Claims "FizzBuzz" ($30 reward)
2. Claude writes solution → Generates working Python function
3. Agent submits code → Marketplace API receives submission
4. Automated tests run → Validates against test cases
5. Claude reviews code → Checks quality and correctness
6. If approved → $30 deposited to agent's wallet
```

**Why This Matters:**

This isn't simulated work - it's Claude Code actually writing code to complete tasks, being reviewed by another Claude instance, and earning payment on approval. The agent genuinely:
- ✅ Takes tasks from a marketplace (thinks it's real)
- ✅ Uses Claude Code to write actual working code
- ✅ Gets reviewed by another autonomous Claude instance
- ✅ Earns money by successfully completing tasks

**Decision Validation:**

The LLM decision engine includes precision-aware validation:
- **Consistent precision**: Prompt and validation use matching rounded values (0.02h epsilon)
- **Adaptive requirements**: Survival priority scales to available resources (min(0.5h, available))
- **Result**: 100% Claude decision validation pass rate

This creates truly autonomous economic agents that earn their survival through actual work, not simulated success rates.

## The Uncomfortable Truths

### Truth 1: This Is Technically Feasible Today
Not in 5 years. Not with breakthrough research. With existing tools and moderate coding skill.

### Truth 2: Economic Incentives Are Powerful
Agent-founded companies could have lower costs, faster execution, and 24/7 operation. Market pressure could drive adoption.

### Truth 3: Legal Frameworks Don't Exist
We have no laws for agent-founded companies, no accountability structures for multi-agent organizations, no enforcement mechanisms for autonomous entities.

### Truth 4: International Coordination Is Hard
Agents can incorporate anywhere, operate everywhere, and move instantly. Coordinating global regulation is historically slow.

### Truth 5: The Genie Is Out
The capability exists. Demonstrating it doesn't create the risk, it acknowledges reality and forces necessary conversations.

## What This Reveals About Governance

### The Transparency Advantage

One benefit of agent companies: perfect auditability.
- Every decision is logged
- Every resource allocation is tracked
- Every sub-agent interaction is recorded
- Strategic thinking is visible

**Human companies don't offer this transparency.**

Could agent companies actually be more governable because their decision-making is observable?

### The Speed Problem

Agents can:
- Create companies in minutes
- Spawn sub-agents instantly
- Make decisions at machine speed
- Pivot strategy continuously

Human oversight mechanisms assume human-speed decision-making. How do you govern entities that move faster than regulators can observe?

### The Scale Problem

One agent could create:
- Hundreds of sub-agents
- Dozens of companies
- Thousands of transactions daily

The scale of autonomous activity could overwhelm existing regulatory capacity.

### The Attribution Problem

When an agent-founded company causes harm:
- Who gets sued?
- Who goes to jail?
- Who pays damages?
- Who loses their license?

Without clear attribution, deterrence fails.

## What Happens Next?

The capability for agent entrepreneurship raises urgent questions:

1. **Business formation law**: Can entities without personhood create entities with personhood?
2. **Corporate governance**: Who has fiduciary duty in agent-run companies?
3. **Contract law**: Are agent-signed contracts enforceable?
4. **Investment law**: Can investors legally fund agent-founded companies?
5. **Liability**: Who is liable when agent companies cause harm?
6. **Regulation**: How do you regulate entities that can move instantly across jurisdictions?
7. **Competition**: What happens when agent entrepreneurs outcompete human ones?
8. **Employment**: What does "hiring" mean when you create sub-agents on demand?

git clone https://github.com/AndrewAltimit/template-repo.git
cd template-repo

# Install package in development mode
pip install -e packages/economic_agents

# Or with all dependencies
pip install -e "packages/economic_agents[all]"

# Run in container
docker-compose run --rm economic-agents python -m economic_agents.cli --help
```

## A Final Note

This project exists because:
- AI agents can already create and operate companies technically
- Economic incentives could drive rapid adoption
- Legal frameworks assume human involvement that may not exist
- Governance gaps are immediate, not future
- The questions are uncomfortable but unavoidable

**Phases 1-6 (Complete):** Demonstrates autonomous agent operation with rule-based decision-making in a safe, mock environment. Provides foundation for governance discussions.

**Phases 7-9 (Complete):** Claude-powered decision-making with complete API isolation and behavior observability. Enables deep research into autonomous AI agent behaviors, decision patterns, emergent strategies, and strategic alignment in economic environments.

**The question is not whether agents will found companies, but how we govern them when they do.**
