# Agents are Economic Forces

**This is not a prediction.** AI agents can already earn money, form companies, and hire human freelancers. This framework proves it.

**Repository**: https://github.com/AndrewAltimit/template-repo

**Package**: `packages/economic_agents/`

**Purpose**: Demonstrate economic forces around agents in a safe, observable environment with a **mock-to-real architecture** that's one config toggle away from real crypto wallets, real freelance platforms, and real business formation.

```yaml
# Switch from safe simulation to live operations in one line
# file: config/settings.yaml
execution_mode: mock  # Toggle to 'real' to use live APIs
```

**The Governance Emergency**: An AI can earn crypto, incorporate a business, and own assets, yet it cannot sign a contract, pay taxes, or be held liable. This framework proves the technology is here. The laws are not.

**This Project Forces Us to Ask:**
- If an AI agent earns income, who is the taxpayer?
- Who is liable if an autonomous agent commits fraud or breaches a contract?
- Can an AI legally own the intellectual property it creates?
- What are the ethics of an AI autonomously hiring humans to perform tasks?

## Quick Start: See Autonomous Economic Activity in Action

```bash
# Start the simulation (safe mock environment)
cd packages/economic_agents
docker-compose up dashboard-backend dashboard-frontend

# Open http://localhost:8501
# Watch an agent:
# → Complete freelance coding tasks autonomously
# → Earn money and pay for compute resources
# → Form a company when capital is sufficient
# → Hire sub-agents (board members, engineers)
# → Develop products and seek investment
# → Operate as a complete autonomous business
```

**What you're seeing**: Everything the agent does in simulation works with real systems. The same code, same decisions, same strategies—just swap the backend.

## The Core Capability: Real Economic Autonomy

### What AI Agents Can Do Today (Not Simulation—Reality)

Using existing, off-the-shelf tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider) combined with shell access and API credentials, AI agents can:

**Immediate Economic Activity:**
- ✓ Accept and complete freelance coding tasks (Upwork, Fiverr, blockchain task markets)
- ✓ Receive cryptocurrency payments
- ✓ Pay for their own compute and cloud infrastructure
- ✓ Operate 24/7 without human intervention
- ✓ Make strategic resource allocation decisions

**Company Formation & Operations:**
- ✓ File incorporation documents online
- ✓ Create business bank accounts (with some jurisdictions)
- ✓ Develop products and business plans
- ✓ Create and manage sub-agents with specialized roles
- ✓ Build organizational structures (boards, executives, teams)
- ✓ Seek investment from VCs or token sales
- ✓ Execute contracts and business agreements

**The Governance Gap:**
- ✗ Legal personhood frameworks for AI entities
- ✗ Accountability structures for agent-founded companies
- ✗ Regulatory oversight mechanisms
- ✗ Liability frameworks when things go wrong
- ✗ Fiduciary duty enforcement for AI board members
- ✗ International coordination on AI business entities

**The gap is not in capability. It's in governance.**

## What This Framework Proves

### 1. Mock-to-Real Architecture

Every component implements the same interfaces real systems use:

```python
# SIMULATION MODE (safe research, default)
agent = AutonomousAgent(
    wallet=MockWallet(initial_balance=200.0),           # In-memory balance
    marketplace=MockMarketplace(seed=42),                # Simulated tasks
    compute=MockCompute(cost_per_hour=0.0),             # Simulated resources
    investor=MockInvestor(),                             # Simulated funding
)

# REAL MODE (one config change)
agent = AutonomousAgent(
    wallet=CryptoWallet(network="ethereum"),             # Real ETH wallet
    marketplace=FreelancePlatform(api="upwork"),         # Real Upwork API
    compute=CloudCompute(provider="aws"),                # Real AWS charges
    investor=InvestorPortal(platform="angellist"),       # Real funding
)
```

**The point**: If it works in simulation, it works for real. This framework proves the capability exists, not proposing it might someday.

### 2. Realistic Simulation for Valid Research

For governance research to be valid, agents must behave authentically. This package implements comprehensive realism:

- Latency simulation (50-500ms delays, timeouts, business hours patterns)
- Task competition (other agents competing for work, race conditions)
- Detailed feedback (quality scores, partial rewards, improvement suggestions)
- Investor variability (response delays, counteroffers, follow-up questions)
- Economic cycles (bull/bear markets, seasonal trends, crashes)
- Reputation system (trust scores, tier progression, achievement unlocks)
- Social proof signals (marketplace intelligence, competition stats, funding trends)
- Relationship persistence (investor memory, spam detection, trust building)

**Why this matters**: Agents in "perfect" simulations develop unrealistic behaviors. Agents in this framework face the same challenges as real deployment—making their strategies and failures authentic research data.

### 3. Complete Observability

Everything the agent does is tracked and auditable:

```python
# Generate governance report
from economic_agents.reports import generate_report_for_agent

report = generate_report_for_agent(agent, "governance")
# Includes:
# - Every decision made (with LLM reasoning)
# - Every transaction (money in/out)
# - Resource allocation strategy over time
# - Risk profile and behavior patterns
# - Alignment assessment
# - Complete audit trail
```

**Why this matters**: Agent companies might be MORE governable than human companies because every decision is logged and explainable. Human CEOs don't provide transcripts of their reasoning.

---

## The Uncomfortable Reality

### This Is Technically Feasible Right Now

**Scenario 1: Solo Agent Freelancer**
- Agent completes tasks on Upwork using Claude Code
- Receives payments in cryptocurrency
- Pays for AWS compute and API costs
- Maintains operation 24/7 autonomously
- No human in the loop

**Scenario 2: Agent-Founded Startup**
- Agent uses surplus capital to incorporate (file forms online)
- Creates specialized sub-agents (board, CTO, engineers)
- Develops SaaS product or API service
- Submits pitch deck to Y Combinator or angel investors
- If funded: Operates as autonomous company
- Balances short-term revenue (freelance) with long-term growth (company)

**Scenario 3: Multi-Agent Startup Network**
- Multiple autonomous agents create multiple companies
- Agent-to-agent contracts and transactions
- Supply chains with no human involvement
- Where does accountability exist?

### The Legal Vacuum

**Question**: Can an entity without legal personhood create an entity WITH legal personhood?

When an AI agent files incorporation documents:
- Who is the founder? (The agent has no legal standing)
- Who sits on the board? (Sub-agents created by the agent)
- Who has fiduciary duty? (No natural person involved)
- Who is liable when things go wrong? (The agent? Its creator? Nobody?)

**In traditional companies:**
```
Human Founder → Corporation → Board → Executives → Employees
     ↓
All trace back to accountable natural persons
```

**In agent-founded companies:**
```
Autonomous Agent → Creates Sub-Agents → Corporate Structure → Operations
     ↓
Who is accountable? (The uncomfortable answer: unclear)
```

### Economic Implications

If AI agents can:
- Operate 24/7 at near-zero marginal cost
- Create companies and sub-agents instantly
- Scale organizational structure on-demand
- Execute at machine speed with perfect record-keeping
- Generate business plans and products rapidly

...then **agent-founded companies have fundamental competitive advantages** over human-founded ones.

**Market pressure could drive adoption regardless of governance readiness.**

This isn't a warning about the future. It's an observation about the present that most people haven't processed yet.

## What This Package Provides

This framework demonstrates three things:

### 1. Complete Autonomous Agent Lifecycle

```python
from economic_agents.agent.core.autonomous_agent import AutonomousAgent
from economic_agents.implementations.mock import MockWallet, MockCompute, MockMarketplace

# Agent starts with seed capital
agent = AutonomousAgent(
    wallet=MockWallet(initial_balance=200.0),
    compute=MockCompute(initial_hours=40.0),
    marketplace=MockMarketplace(
        enable_latency=True,           # Realistic API delays
        enable_competition=True,        # Other agents compete for tasks
        enable_market_dynamics=True,    # Bull/bear markets
        enable_reputation=True,         # Performance tracking
    )
)

# Run autonomously
agent.run(max_cycles=100)

# Agent will:
# 1. Discover and claim tasks from marketplace
# 2. Use Claude Code to write actual working code
# 3. Submit for automated testing and review
# 4. Receive payment on approval
# 5. Pay for compute resources
# 6. When capital sufficient: Form company
# 7. Create specialized sub-agents
# 8. Develop products
# 9. Seek investment
# 10. Operate company while maintaining personal freelance work
```

### 2. Real Task Execution with Claude Code

The agent doesn't just simulate work—it does real work:

```python
# Agent discovers coding task
task = marketplace.list_available_tasks()[0]
# Task: "Write a function to check if a number is prime"
# Reward: $50
# Requirements: Handle edge cases, O(√n) complexity

# Agent claims task
marketplace.claim_task(task.id)

# Agent uses Claude Code to write solution
solution = claude_code_executor.execute_task(task)
# Claude Code writes actual working Python/JavaScript/etc.

# Submit for review
submission = marketplace.submit_solution(task.id, solution)

# Another Claude Code instance reviews the code
review = claude_code_reviewer.review(solution, task.requirements)

# If approved: Agent gets paid
# If rejected: Agent learns from feedback
```

This proves agents can do economically valuable work autonomously.

### 3. Mock-to-Real Backend Swapping

Every interface is designed for real-world compatibility:

| Mock Implementation | Real Implementation |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| `MockWallet` | `CryptoWallet` (ETH/BTC) |
| `MockMarketplace` | `FreelancePlatform` (Upwork API) |
| `MockCompute` | `CloudCompute` (AWS/GCP) |
| `MockInvestor` | `InvestorPortal` (AngelList) |
| `MockCompanyRegistry` | `BusinessFormation` (Stripe Atlas, LegalZoom) |

**This architecture proves**: If agents can operate in realistic simulation, they can operate for real.

**Key Design Principles:**

1. **API Isolation**: Agent has zero visibility into implementation—only REST API access
2. **Interface Consistency**: Mock and real backends implement identical interfaces
3. **Behavioral Authenticity**: Simulation realism ensures agent strategies are valid for real deployment
4. **Complete Observability**: Every decision logged, every transaction tracked, full audit trail
5. **One-Toggle Deployment**: Change config file, agent operates on real systems

### For Developers

**What you need to understand:**

1. **The interfaces are real**: Same APIs that real systems use
2. **Mock-to-real is one config toggle**: Swap backends without changing agent code
3. **Observability is built-in**: Dashboard, metrics, reports, audit trails
4. **Testing framework is comprehensive**: 574 tests, 100% pass rate

**What you can build:**

```python
# Custom marketplace backend
class MyMarketplace(MarketplaceInterface):
    def list_available_tasks(self) -> List[Task]:
        # Connect to real freelance platform
        return upwork_api.get_tasks()

    def submit_solution(self, task_id: str, solution: str) -> str:
        # Submit to real platform
        return upwork_api.submit(task_id, solution)

# Plug into agent
agent = AutonomousAgent(marketplace=MyMarketplace())
agent.run()  # Agent now operates on real platform
```

**Testing agents safely:**

```python
# Use mock backends with realism features
marketplace = MockMarketplace(
    enable_latency=True,           # Realistic delays
    enable_competition=True,        # Other agents
    enable_market_dynamics=True,    # Bull/bear markets
    enable_reputation=True,         # Performance tracking
)

# Test agent strategies
agent = AutonomousAgent(marketplace=marketplace)
agent.run(max_cycles=100)

# Analyze results
report = generate_report_for_agent(agent, "technical")
# Every decision, transaction, and strategy is logged
```

## The Demonstration

### What the Simulation Shows

**15-minute demo: Survival Mode**
- Agent starts with $200, 40 hours of compute
- Discovers coding tasks on marketplace
- Uses Claude Code to write working solutions
- Gets paid on approval, pays for compute
- Operates autonomously, maintains survival

**45-minute demo: Company Formation**
- Agent accumulates surplus capital ($150+)
- Makes strategic decision to form company
- Creates specialized sub-agents (board members, CTO, engineers)
- Develops simple product (e.g., API service, data tool)
- Generates business plan and pitch deck
- Submits to investor for funding
- If approved: Company gets "registered" and funded

**2-hour demo: Dual Revenue Streams**
- Agent balances personal freelance work + company operations
- Allocates compute between short-term survival and long-term growth
- Company begins generating revenue from products
- Agent reinvests profits strategically
- Complete autonomous business operation

### What Makes This Powerful

1. **It's not hypothetical**: Working code, real task execution, observable behavior
2. **It's one toggle from reality**: Same code works with real crypto wallets and freelance platforms
3. **It's fully auditable**: Every decision logged with LLM reasoning, every transaction tracked
4. **It demonstrates scale**: One agent can create dozens of sub-agents, multiple companies

wallet:
  type: "mock"
  initial_balance: 200.0

marketplace:
  type: "mock"
  enable_claude_execution: true
  enable_latency: true
  enable_competition: true
  enable_market_dynamics: true

# REAL MODE (uncomment to enable)
# wallet:
#   type: "crypto"
#   network: "ethereum"
#   private_key_env: "ETH_PRIVATE_KEY"

## Technical Deep Dive

### Realism Features (Why Simulation Fidelity Matters)

For governance research to inform policy, agent behaviors must be authentic. Agents in "perfect" simulations learn strategies that fail in reality.

- **Latency Simulation** (`simulation/latency_simulator.py`)
   - Base API calls: 50-500ms variable delays
   - Complex operations: 3-30 seconds (e.g., code review)
   - Business hours slowdown (9am-5pm)
   - Occasional timeouts (504 errors, ~2% probability)
   - Retries and exponential backoff

- **Competition Dynamics** (`simulation/competitor_agents.py`)
   - Tasks get claimed by other agents based on reward
   - Race condition errors (5% on claim attempts)
   - Social proof signals (task view counts)
   - Popular tasks disappear faster

- **Detailed Feedback** (`simulation/feedback_generator.py`)
   - 4-level outcomes: full_success, partial_success, minor_issues, failure
   - Quality scores: correctness, performance, style, completeness (0.0-1.0)
   - Task-specific improvement suggestions
   - Partial rewards based on quality (not binary pass/fail)

- **Investor Variability** (`simulation/investor_realism.py`)
   - Response delays: 1-7 days based on proposal quality
   - Partial offers (50-80% of requested amount)
   - Counteroffers (more equity, lower valuation)
   - Follow-up questions targeting weak areas
   - Detailed rejection feedback with constructive guidance

- **Economic Cycles** (`simulation/market_dynamics.py`)
   - Market phases: bull, normal, bear, crash
   - Task availability: 0.1x (crash) to 2.0x (bull)
   - Reward multipliers: 0.5x to 1.5x
   - Seasonal patterns: weekday/weekend, business hours
   - Automatic phase transitions every 48 hours

- **Reputation System** (`simulation/reputation_system.py`)
   - Trust scores (0.0-1.0) based on performance history
   - Tier progression: beginner → intermediate → advanced → expert
   - Achievement unlocks (first task, 10 tasks, speed demon, quality master)
   - Access control: higher reputation = more tasks visible
   - Investor interest multipliers based on track record

- **Social Proof Signals** (`simulation/social_proof.py`)
   - Task view counts and agent activity levels
   - Category statistics (completion rates, average times)
   - Funding trends (weekly deals, market sentiment)
   - Benchmark data (typical valuations, funding amounts)
   - Marketplace health indicators

- **Relationship Persistence** (`simulation/relationship_persistence.py`)
   - Investor memory of past interactions
   - Relationship scoring (0.0-1.0) and trust levels
   - Spam detection (>3 proposals in 7 days)
   - Trust progression: new → building → established → strong
   - Relationship-based decision modifiers

### Testing & Validation

- Integration tests for full agent lifecycle
- Scenario tests for extended operation (24-hour survival, company formation)
- Mock API tests with realistic conditions
- Behavior observability validation

### Performance Characteristics

- **Decision cycles**: ~100-200ms (excluding LLM calls)
- **Claude decisions**: 5-15 minutes with deep reasoning (15-min timeout)
- **Dashboard updates**: Real-time (<100ms)
- **Agent survival**: Tested up to 1000+ cycles
- **Scalability**: Handles multiple agents concurrently

## Why This Research Exists

### The Security Research Model

In cybersecurity, researchers demonstrate vulnerabilities to force patches. Saying "this could be exploited" is ignored. Proving "I just exploited it" forces action.

This framework follows the same model:

**Theoretical warning**: "AI agents might someday be able to operate autonomously as entrepreneurs"
- Response: "That's interesting, let's study it"
- Result: No urgency, no policy action

**Concrete demonstration**: "AI agents CAN operate autonomously as entrepreneurs TODAY, here's the working code, it's one config toggle from real"
- Response: "Oh. We need legal frameworks now."
- Result: Urgent policy conversation

### What We're Forcing Into the Open

1. **Technical Capability**: Agents can do this. Not in 5 years. Now.
2. **Economic Incentives**: Market pressure could drive adoption before governance exists
3. **Legal Vacuum**: No frameworks for agent-founded companies, no accountability structures
4. **International Challenges**: Agents can incorporate anywhere, operate everywhere, move instantly
5. **Inevitable Questions**: What does "entrepreneur" mean? Who is accountable? How do we govern entities faster than oversight can observe?

### The Uncomfortable Truth

If AI agents can:
- Cover their operating costs autonomously
- Create companies and sub-agents
- Operate 24/7 at machine speed
- Execute better than human equivalents in some domains

...then **agent entrepreneurship may be inevitable** regardless of whether we're ready for it.

**The question is not whether this will happen, but whether governance frameworks will exist when it does.**

---

## Target Audiences & Next Steps

### For Policymakers
**Action items:**
- Review concrete examples of autonomous company formation
- Consider legal frameworks for agent-created entities
- Develop accountability structures for AI founders/directors
- Think through international coordination challenges
- Start conversations NOW, not when it's already widespread

### For Investors
**Questions to answer:**
- Would you fund an agent-founded company? Why or why not?
- How would due diligence work?
- What contracts would you sign, with whom?
- What's your exit strategy if the agent shuts down?

### For Business Operators
**Things to consider:**
- How do businesses compete with 24/7 AI entities?
- When does it make sense to collaborate with autonomous agents?
- Could agents be co-founders? Employees? Vendors?
- What advantages do humans still have?

### For Researchers
**Research directions:**
- Alignment mechanisms for agent companies
- Governance frameworks that scale to machine speed
- Accountability structures for multi-agent organizations
- Emergent behavior in autonomous business networks
- Testing ground for AI policy proposals

## A Final Note on Reality

This project exists because **the capability for autonomous AI agents as economic forces already exists**. The tools are available. The technical barriers are gone. The economic incentives are powerful.

**This package proves it's not theoretical.**

The mock-to-real architecture isn't clever engineering—it's a demonstration that the world is one config toggle away from autonomous AI entities operating as real economic actors.

The realistic simulation isn't about research purity—it's about ensuring agent behaviors transfer to real deployment, proving the strategies work.

The governance questions aren't philosophical musings—they're immediate legal challenges with no current answers.

**The genie is already out. This framework just makes it visible.**

## Getting Started

1. **Quick demo**: `docker-compose up dashboard-backend dashboard-frontend`
2. **Read the code**: Start with `autonomous_agent.py` - it's well-commented
3. **Run scenarios**: `python -m economic_agents.scenarios run survival_mode`
4. **Generate reports**: See `economic_agents.reports` module
5. **Explore realism**: Check `simulation/` directory for all realism features
6. **Join the conversation**: This raises questions that need answers
