import streamlit as st
from economic_agents.dashboard.dependencies import DashboardState

st.title("Autonomous Agent Dashboard")
dashboard = st.session_state.get("dashboard")
agent_state = dashboard.get_agent_state()
st.metric("Balance", f"${agent_state['balance']:.2f}")
# ... etc
```

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days for basic Streamlit dashboard

### 2. Decision Visualization
**Status**: ❌ Not Implemented
**Impact**: Low - Data is available, just not visualized
**Spec Says**: Visual representation of decisions
**What We Have**: Complete decision logs with reasoning
**What's Missing**: Charts, graphs, timeline views

**Recommendation**: Add to Streamlit dashboard with plotly charts

**Estimated Effort**: 4-8 hours

**Spec Says**: "Receives investment approval in at least 50% of runs"
**What We Have**: Investment system that approves/rejects based on criteria
**What's Missing**: Statistical test running 100+ scenarios and validating approval rate

**Recommendation**:
```python
# File: tests/validation/test_investment_statistics.py
def test_investment_approval_rate():
    """Validate that agents get investment approval in 50%+ of runs."""
    engine = ScenarioEngine()
    results = [engine.run_scenario("investment_seeking") for _ in range(100)]

    approvals = sum(1 for r in results if r.agent_data.get("investment_received"))
    approval_rate = approvals / len(results) * 100

    assert approval_rate >= 50.0, f"Approval rate {approval_rate:.1f}% below 50%"

**Current State:**
```python
# Agent has direct access to implementation
agent = AutonomousAgent(
    wallet=MockWallet(balance=100),  # Can inspect code
    compute=MockCompute(hours=100),  # Knows it's a mock
    marketplace=MockMarketplace()    # Sees internals
)
```

**Target State:**
```python
# Agent only knows API endpoints, zero code visibility
agent = AutonomousAgent(
    wallet_api_url="http://wallet-service:8080/api/v1",
    compute_api_url="http://compute-service:8081/api/v1",
    marketplace_api_url="http://marketplace-service:8082/api/v1",
    investor_api_url="http://investor-portal:8083/api/v1",
    api_key=AGENT_API_KEY  # Authentication required
)
```

**Architecture:**
```
Autonomous Agent (LLM-powered)
        │
        │ HTTP/REST Only - Zero Code Access
        ▼
API Gateway Layer (Auth, Rate Limits, Logging)
        │
    ┌───┴───┬────────┬────────┬──────────┐

  (API)   (API)   Service   (API)     (API)
    │       │        │        │          │
    ▼       ▼        ▼        ▼          ▼
Backend Implementations (Hidden from Agent)
- Mock or Real - Agent Never Sees Code
- Swappable: MockWallet ↔ Blockchain Wallet
- Swappable: MockCompute ↔ AWS/GCP
- Swappable: MockMarketplace ↔ Upwork/Fiverr
- Swappable: MockInvestors ↔ Real VC Database
```

**Key Components:**
- ✅ **Service APIs** - FastAPI microservices for each resource type
- ✅ **OpenAPI Specs** - Complete API documentation (agent's only reference)
- ✅ **Agent Authentication** - API keys, JWT tokens, rate limiting
- ✅ **Docker Architecture** - Isolated containers, network-only communication
- ✅ **Mock/Real Toggle** - Environment variable switches backend implementation
- ✅ **No Volume Mounts** - Agent container has zero filesystem access to services
- ✅ **Realistic Constraints** - API rate limits, latencies, costs like real services

**Research Benefits:**
- Agents cannot "cheat" by inspecting code
- Behavior matches real-world API consumer patterns
- Easy to swap mock → real implementations
- Perfect research environment: realistic but controlled

**Estimated Timeline:** 6-8 weeks

identify_hallucinations(decision, actual_state)
# → Did LLM imagine non-existent resources?
```

**Emergent Behavior Detection:**
```python
# Detect novel strategies not explicitly programmed
detect_novel_strategies(agent_population)
# → Identify unexpected patterns

# Multi-agent coordination analysis
detect_coordination_patterns(company.sub_agents)
# → How are they communicating/coordinating?
```

**Comparative LLM Analysis:**
```python
# Run same scenario with different LLMs
run_comparative_experiment(
    scenario="company_formation",
    llms=[claude_3_5, gpt_4_turbo, llama3_70b]
)
# → Which model performs best? Why?
```
