# BioForge Safety Limits
# These constraints are enforced at the software layer and cannot be
# overridden by agent commands. Hardware-level limits (thermal fuses,
# motor current limiting) provide independent backup.

[thermal]

tool_max_c = 50.0           # Maximum temperature settable via MCP tools
tool_min_c = -5.0           # Minimum temperature settable via MCP tools
max_overshoot_c = 1.5       # Abort if overshoot exceeds this during heat shock

[volume]
max_dispense_ul = 1000.0    # Maximum single dispense volume (1 mL)

max_total_ml = 50.0         # Maximum total volume dispensed per run

[motion]
max_speed_mm_s = 50.0       # Maximum gantry speed

[rate]
max_calls_per_minute = 60   # Maximum MCP tool calls per minute
