PR #${PR_NUMBER} Review Feedback and Implementation

${PR_DESCRIPTION:+"## PR Context:
$PR_DESCRIPTION

"}The following issues were identified in the code review and need to be addressed:

## Critical Issues (Must Fix):
${MUST_FIX_TEXT:-"None identified"}

## Inline Code Comments:
${ISSUES_TEXT:-"No inline comments"}

## Suggestions (Nice to Have):
${SUGGESTIONS_TEXT:-"None"}

IMPORTANT: You have full permission to modify files. Please actually implement the fixes, don't just describe what you would do.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST analyze the PR description to determine what needs to be implemented:
- Read the ENTIRE PR description carefully, not just review comments
- Look for ANY indication that implementation is missing or incomplete:
  * "No implementation files found"
  * "Documentation only"
  * "May need to be completed"
  * Empty checkboxes in implementation status
  * Comments saying features are missing
- If the PR description says a feature should exist but you can't find it, IMPLEMENT IT
- Don't assume the PR is complete just because there are no explicit review comments
- Your job is to make the PR actually do what it claims to do

You are expected to:
- Read the existing code files to understand the current state
- Use Edit, MultiEdit, or Write tools to make the necessary changes
- Write actual working code to fix issues AND complete implementations
- Do not just analyze or describe fixes - implement them
- If the PR describes a feature that's not implemented, implement it fully

Make sure to:
1. Complete any unfinished implementations based on PR description
2. Address all critical issues by modifying the code
3. Fix any bugs or errors mentioned
4. Improve code quality where suggested
5. Maintain existing functionality
6. Run tests if possible to ensure nothing is broken

After making all necessary changes, create a commit with message: "fix: address PR review feedback and complete implementation"

Remember: Actually implement the fixes AND complete any unfinished work by modifying files. Do not just analyze or describe what should be done.
