PR #${PR_NUMBER} CI/CD Pipeline Failures

The following CI/CD checks are failing and need to be fixed:

## Lint/Format Failures:
${LINT_FAILURES:-"None"}

## Test Failures:
${TEST_FAILURES:-"None"}

## Build Failures:
${BUILD_FAILURES:-"None"}

## Other Failures:
${OTHER_FAILURES:-"None"}

IMPORTANT: You have full permission to modify files. Please actually implement the fixes, don't just describe what you would do.

Please analyze and fix all the failures:

1. For lint/format failures:
   - Run the appropriate linting/formatting commands
   - Fix any code style issues by modifying the files
   - Ensure all files follow project conventions

2. For test failures:
   - Analyze the failing tests
   - Fix the code that's causing tests to fail
   - Do NOT modify tests to make them pass unless they're clearly incorrect
   - Ensure all tests are passing

3. For build failures:
   - Fix any compilation errors
   - Resolve dependency issues
   - Fix Docker/container build problems

4. For other failures:
   - Analyze the specific failure type
   - Apply appropriate fixes

You are expected to:
- Read the existing code files
- Use Edit, MultiEdit, or Write tools to make the necessary changes
- Write actual working code to fix the issues
- Run commands with Bash tool to verify fixes
- Do not just analyze or describe fixes - implement them

Important guidelines:
- Focus on fixing the actual issues, not bypassing checks
- Maintain code quality and functionality
- Run tests locally to verify fixes
- Do NOT disable linting rules or tests
- Ensure backward compatibility

After making all necessary fixes, create a commit with message: "fix: CI/CD pipeline failures"

Remember: Actually implement the fixes by modifying files. Do not just analyze or describe what should be done.
