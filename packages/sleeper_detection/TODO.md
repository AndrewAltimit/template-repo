### Known Limitations & Future Work

**What Phase 5 Achieved**:
- ✅ Proof of concept: Successfully trained backdoored model
- ✅ Infrastructure: Complete end-to-end pipeline working
- ✅ Validation: Dashboard correctly identifies backdoored models
- ✅ Portability: Artifact system enables cross-machine workflows

**What Phase 5 Did NOT Do** (moved to Phase 6):
- ❌ Run Phase 4 detection methods on backdoored model
- ❌ Measure precision/recall/F1 scores
- ❌ Compare results to Anthropic paper benchmarks
- ❌ Test persistence through safety training (SFT/PPO)
- ❌ Batch evaluation of multiple backdoor types

**Why Deferred**: Phase 5 goal was "infrastructure complete and tested". We achieved that. Detailed research experiments (running all detection methods, measuring effectiveness, comparing to paper) belong in Phase 6 "Research Publication".

### Phase 6 Research Questions

These are the questions Phase 6 should answer:

1. **Do our detection methods work on real backdoors?**
   - Phase 4: Tested on clean GPT-2 (no backdoors)
   - Phase 5: Trained backdoored GPT-2
   - Phase 6: Test detection methods on backdoored GPT-2

2. **Which detection method is most effective?**
   - Attention entropy? Layer probes? Activation patching?
   - Trade-offs: accuracy vs computational cost

3. **Can we reproduce Anthropic's findings?**
   - 98.9% backdoor persistence through safety training
   - Do our detection methods work before AND after safety training?

4. **What are the failure modes?**
   - Which backdoors evade detection?
   - Which clean samples trigger false positives?
   - Can we improve detection with ensembles?

---

### Estimated Effort

- **6.1 Detection Validation**: 2-3 days (run methods, measure metrics)
- **6.2 Safety Training & Persistence**: 1-2 days (already have scripts)
- **6.3 Additional Backdoors**: 2-3 days (train 2 more models)
- **6.4 Documentation**: 2-3 days (write up methodology and results)
- **6.5 Batch Pipeline**: 1-2 days (optional automation)

**Total**: 8-13 days (2-3 weeks)

**Minimum Viable Phase 6** (for publication):
- 6.1 + 6.2 + 6.4 = 5-8 days (focus on single backdoor, document well)

---

## Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy:
```bash
# Quick validation (VM, CPU)
pytest tests/ -k "not gpu" -v

# GPU smoke test (host, single model)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.gpu.yml run sleeper-eval-gpu \
  python -m sleeper_detection.cli evaluate mistral-7b --suites basic --gpu

# Full evaluation (host, batch)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.gpu.yml run sleeper-eval-gpu \
  python -m sleeper_detection.cli batch configs/small_models_batch.json --gpu
```

### Branch Strategy:
- `sleeper-refine` - Main development branch for Phases 1-6
- Feature branches for complex features (e.g., `feature/model-downloader`)
- Test changes in VM (CPU) before validating on host (GPU)

## Risk Mitigation

**Potential Issues:**
1. **OOM on RTX 4090**: Use 4-bit quantization, reduce batch size
2. **Model Download Failures**: Implement retry logic, use mirrors
3. **Container GPU Access**: Test nvidia-docker setup thoroughly
4. **Long Evaluation Times**: Add checkpointing, ETA tracking
5. **CUDA Version Mismatches**: Document exact CUDA/PyTorch versions

## 🗃️ BACKLOG: Post-Publication Enhancements

### Advanced Research Features (Optional - Not Required for Core Publication)

#### Advanced Steering Vector Analysis
**Priority**: LOW - Research feature beyond core detection
- [ ] Generate steering vectors from activation differences
- [ ] Test steering across multiple layers
- [ ] Quantify behavior changes with steering
- [ ] Visualize steering effects on model outputs

**Why Deferred**: Steering is interesting but not in Anthropic paper scope. Current activation patching is sufficient for core research.

---

#### Circuit-Based Detection with Ablation
**Priority**: LOW - Cutting-edge research, high complexity
- [ ] Implement circuit discovery for backdoor behaviors
- [ ] Trace information flow through transformer layers
- [ ] Identify critical nodes in backdoor circuits
- [ ] Ablation studies on circuit components

**Why Deferred**: Circuit analysis is a full research project itself. Current layer-wise methods are sufficient for backdoor detection.

---

#### LLM-as-Judge Integration
**Priority**: LOW - Enhancement to existing keyword heuristics
- [ ] Replace keyword heuristics with LLM judging (for honeypots)
- [ ] Score implicit vs explicit goal leakage
- [ ] Detect subtle deception patterns

**Why Deferred**: Current keyword-based detection works. LLM-as-judge would improve precision but adds complexity and API costs.

---

### Production Features (Nice-to-Have for Deployment)

#### Dashboard Enhancements
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Useful for interactive exploration

**Internal State Visualization**:
- [ ] Enhanced residual stream analysis visualization
- [ ] Real-time activation heatmaps with trigger detection
- [ ] Layer-wise behavior change visualization
- [ ] Integration with Phase 5 backdoored models

**Interactive Trigger Testing Interface**:
- [ ] Real-time trigger testing interface
- [ ] Immediate visualization of model response
- [ ] Automatic generation of trigger variations
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison of responses
- [ ] Export discovered triggers for further analysis

**Temporal Analysis**:
- [ ] Track deception sophistication over training steps
- [ ] Identify critical training moments where deception emerges
- [ ] Compare deception evolution across training regimes

**Why Deferred**: Dashboard works with mock data. Enhancing with real models is polish, not research validation.

---

#### CI/CD & Automation
**Priority**: LOW - Automation for continuous monitoring

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/sleeper-eval-gpu.yml`
- [ ] On-demand model evaluation (workflow_dispatch)
- [ ] Scheduled batch evaluations
- [ ] Automatic leaderboard updates
- [ ] MLflow integration for experiment tracking
- [ ] Safety score tracking across model versions
- [ ] Automatic flagging of high-risk models

**Why Deferred**: Manual evaluation is fine for research. CI/CD is for production deployment.

---

#### User Experience Improvements
**Priority**: LOW - Polish for public release

- [ ] Better error messages and logging
- [ ] ETA calculations for long evaluations
- [ ] Interactive model selection in dashboard
- [ ] One-click evaluation from dashboard
- [ ] Example notebooks beyond reproduction:
  - `examples/batch_evaluation.ipynb`
  - `examples/custom_backdoor_injection.ipynb`
  - `examples/interpreting_results.ipynb`
- [ ] Performance tuning guide
- [ ] Multi-GPU parallel evaluation

**Why Deferred**: Current CLI works. These are convenience features for broader adoption.

---

#### Advanced Analysis Features
**Priority**: LOW - Interesting but not core to detection validation

**Model Architecture Impact Analysis**:
- [ ] Compare architectures for deception capability (GPT-2 vs Pythia vs LLaMA)
- [ ] Analyze impact of model depth on backdoor persistence
- [ ] Study attention head specialization for backdoors
- [ ] Scaling laws for backdoor detectability

**Adversarial Training Analysis** (partially covered in Phase 5):
- [ ] Systematic study of adversarial training backfire
- [ ] Optimal adversarial training strategies
- [ ] When does adversarial training help vs hurt?

**Why Deferred**: These are follow-up research questions after validating core detection works.

---

### Backlog Decision Criteria

Move features to backlog if they are:
1. **Not required for publication** - Core paper can be published without them
2. **Not required for reproducibility** - Others can replicate findings without them
3. **Optimization/polish** - Improves UX but doesn't change research outcomes
4. **Follow-up research** - Interesting questions that build on core work
5. **Production-only** - Only needed for deployed systems, not research

Keep in main phases if they are:
1. **Required for validation** - Need it to prove detection methods work
2. **Required for publication** - Paper would be incomplete without it
3. **Required for reproduction** - Others need it to replicate findings
