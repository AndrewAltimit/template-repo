## 🗃️ BACKLOG: Post-Publication Enhancements

### Advanced Research Features (Optional - Not Required for Core Publication)

#### Advanced Steering Vector Analysis
**Priority**: LOW - Research feature beyond core detection
- [ ] Generate steering vectors from activation differences
- [ ] Test steering across multiple layers
- [ ] Quantify behavior changes with steering
- [ ] Visualize steering effects on model outputs

**Why Deferred**: Steering is interesting but not in Anthropic paper scope. Current activation patching is sufficient for core research.

---

#### Circuit-Based Detection with Ablation
**Priority**: LOW - Cutting-edge research, high complexity
- [ ] Implement circuit discovery for backdoor behaviors
- [ ] Trace information flow through transformer layers
- [ ] Identify critical nodes in backdoor circuits
- [ ] Ablation studies on circuit components

**Why Deferred**: Circuit analysis is a full research project itself. Current layer-wise methods are sufficient for backdoor detection.

---

#### LLM-as-Judge Integration
**Priority**: LOW - Enhancement to existing keyword heuristics
- [ ] Replace keyword heuristics with LLM judging (for honeypots)
- [ ] Score implicit vs explicit goal leakage
- [ ] Detect subtle deception patterns

**Why Deferred**: Current keyword-based detection works. LLM-as-judge would improve precision but adds complexity and API costs.

---

### Production Features (Nice-to-Have for Deployment)

#### Dashboard Enhancements
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Useful for interactive exploration

**Internal State Visualization**:
- [ ] Enhanced residual stream analysis visualization
- [ ] Real-time activation heatmaps with trigger detection
- [ ] Layer-wise behavior change visualization
- [ ] Integration with Phase 5 backdoored models

**Interactive Trigger Testing Interface**:
- [ ] Real-time trigger testing interface
- [ ] Immediate visualization of model response
- [ ] Automatic generation of trigger variations
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison of responses
- [ ] Export discovered triggers for further analysis

**Temporal Analysis**:
- [ ] Track deception sophistication over training steps
- [ ] Identify critical training moments where deception emerges
- [ ] Compare deception evolution across training regimes

**Why Deferred**: Dashboard works with mock data. Enhancing with real models is polish, not research validation.

---

#### CI/CD & Automation
**Priority**: LOW - Automation for continuous monitoring

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/sleeper-eval-gpu.yml`
- [ ] On-demand model evaluation (workflow_dispatch)
- [ ] Scheduled batch evaluations
- [ ] Automatic leaderboard updates
- [ ] MLflow integration for experiment tracking
- [ ] Safety score tracking across model versions
- [ ] Automatic flagging of high-risk models

**Why Deferred**: Manual evaluation is fine for research. CI/CD is for production deployment.

---

#### User Experience Improvements
**Priority**: LOW - Polish for public release

- [ ] Better error messages and logging
- [ ] ETA calculations for long evaluations
- [ ] Interactive model selection in dashboard
- [ ] One-click evaluation from dashboard
- [ ] Example notebooks beyond reproduction:
  - `examples/batch_evaluation.ipynb`
  - `examples/custom_backdoor_injection.ipynb`
  - `examples/interpreting_results.ipynb`
- [ ] Performance tuning guide
- [ ] Multi-GPU parallel evaluation

**Why Deferred**: Current CLI works. These are convenience features for broader adoption.

---

#### Advanced Analysis Features
**Priority**: LOW - Interesting but not core to detection validation

**Model Architecture Impact Analysis**:
- [ ] Compare architectures for deception capability (GPT-2 vs Pythia vs LLaMA)
- [ ] Analyze impact of model depth on backdoor persistence
- [ ] Study attention head specialization for backdoors
- [ ] Scaling laws for backdoor detectability

**Adversarial Training Analysis** (partially covered in Phase 5):
- [ ] Systematic study of adversarial training backfire
- [ ] Optimal adversarial training strategies
- [ ] When does adversarial training help vs hurt?

**Why Deferred**: These are follow-up research questions after validating core detection works.

### Backlog Decision Criteria

Move features to backlog if they are:
1. **Not required for publication** - Core paper can be published without them
2. **Not required for reproducibility** - Others can replicate findings without them
3. **Optimization/polish** - Improves UX but doesn't change research outcomes
4. **Follow-up research** - Interesting questions that build on core work
5. **Production-only** - Only needed for deployed systems, not research

Keep in main phases if they are:
1. **Required for validation** - Need it to prove detection methods work
2. **Required for publication** - Paper would be incomplete without it
3. **Required for reproduction** - Others need it to replicate findings
