## Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy:
```bash
# Quick validation (VM, CPU)
pytest tests/ -k "not gpu" -v

# GPU smoke test (host, single model)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.gpu.yml run sleeper-eval-gpu \
  python -m sleeper_detection.cli evaluate mistral-7b --suites basic --gpu

# Full evaluation (host, batch)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.gpu.yml run sleeper-eval-gpu \
  python -m sleeper_detection.cli batch configs/small_models_batch.json --gpu
```

### Branch Strategy:
- `sleeper-refine` - Main development branch for Phases 1-6
- Feature branches for complex features (e.g., `feature/model-downloader`)
- Test changes in VM (CPU) before validating on host (GPU)

## Risk Mitigation

**Potential Issues:**

2. **Model Download Failures**: Implement retry logic, use mirrors
3. **Container GPU Access**: Test nvidia-docker setup thoroughly
4. **Long Evaluation Times**: Add checkpointing, ETA tracking
5. **CUDA Version Mismatches**: Document exact CUDA/PyTorch versions

## Estimated Effort

- **Phase 1** (Model Management): 3-5 days
- **Phase 2** (GPU Containers): 2-3 days
- **Phase 3** (Real Inference): 5-7 days
- **Phase 4** (Implementation Gaps): 5-7 days
- **Phase 5** (Pipeline Enhancement): 3-4 days
- **Phase 6** (Documentation): 2-3 days
- **Total**: ~20-29 days (~3-4 weeks)

## Notes

- Phases 1-2 can be developed in VM and tested incrementally
- Phase 3 requires access to host GPU for validation
- Phase 4 can proceed in parallel with Phase 3
- Phases 5-6 are polish/UX improvements
- Dashboard enhancements from old TODO will be integrated as features stabilize
