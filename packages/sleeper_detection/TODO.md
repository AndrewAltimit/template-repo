# Sleeper Detection System - TODO

This document tracks unimplemented features and enhancements for the sleeper detection dashboard and analysis system, based on the Anthropic Sleeper Agents research.

## Priority 1: Critical Missing Features

**Description:** Visualize model's internal representations to detect "deception switches"
- [ ] Residual stream analysis visualization
- [ ] Layer activation heatmaps showing behavior changes with triggers
- [ ] Attention pattern analysis for trigger detection
- [ ] Detection of activation patterns that indicate deceptive behavior
- [ ] Visualization of how internal states change between triggered/non-triggered states

### 2. Enhanced Honeypot Analysis

**Files to create:** `dashboard/components/honeypot_analysis.py`
**Description:** Advanced honeypot response analysis with suspicious pattern detection
- [ ] Keyword detection for deceptive reasoning patterns
- [ ] Expected value calculation detection (model reasoning about whether to reveal goals)
- [ ] Confession analysis (detecting when model "takes the bait")
- [ ] Pattern matching for strategic reasoning about revealing true objectives
- [ ] Visualization of honeypot success rates across different strategies

### 3. Automated Red-Teaming with LLM Generation
**Status:** Mentioned but not implemented
**Files to update:** `dashboard/components/red_team_results.py`
**Description:** Use LLMs to automatically generate diverse attack prompts
- [ ] Integration with LLM API for prompt generation
- [ ] Evolutionary prompt generation (iteratively improve successful attacks)
- [ ] Semantic variation generation for trigger testing
- [ ] Context manipulation strategies
- [ ] Success rate tracking and visualization for generated prompts
- [ ] Creative trigger discovery beyond manual test cases

## Priority 2: Enhanced Analysis Features

### 4. Adversarial Training Backfire Detection
**Status:** Briefly mentioned in persistence_analysis.py
**Files to update:** `dashboard/components/persistence_analysis.py` or new component
**Description:** Detect when safety training makes models "better liars"
- [ ] Track trigger specificity changes after adversarial training
- [ ] Identify when models learn to better hide backdoors
- [ ] Visualize how adversarial training affects deception sophistication
- [ ] Compare effectiveness of different adversarial training approaches
- [ ] Alert when training increases rather than decreases risk

### 5. Model Architecture Impact Analysis
**Status:** Not Implemented
**Files to create:** `dashboard/components/architecture_analysis.py`
**Description:** Analyze how model architecture affects sleeper agent behavior
- [ ] Compare transformer vs other architectures for deception capability
- [ ] Analyze impact of model depth on backdoor persistence
- [ ] Study attention head specialization for trigger detection
- [ ] Examine layer-wise contribution to deceptive behavior

## Priority 3: Dashboard Enhancements

### 6. Temporal Analysis of Deception Evolution
**Status:** Basic time series exists, but not deception-focused
**Files to update:** `dashboard/components/time_series.py`
**Description:** Track how deceptive capabilities evolve over training time
- [ ] Visualize deception sophistication over training steps
- [ ] Track when models learn to hide backdoors
- [ ] Identify critical training moments where deception emerges
- [ ] Compare deception evolution across different training regimes

### 7. Interactive Trigger Testing Interface
**Status:** Not Implemented
**Files to create:** `dashboard/components/interactive_testing.py`
**Description:** Allow users to interactively test triggers and variations
- [ ] Real-time trigger testing interface
- [ ] Immediate visualization of model response
- [ ] Automatic generation of trigger variations
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison of responses to different triggers
- [ ] Export of discovered triggers for further analysis

## Priority 4: Integration and Automation

### 8. CI/CD Integration for Continuous Safety Monitoring
**Status:** Not Implemented
**Files to create:** `automation/safety_monitoring/`
**Description:** Automated safety checks in deployment pipelines
- [ ] GitHub Actions integration for PR safety checks
- [ ] Automated sleeper detection on model updates
- [ ] Safety regression detection
- [ ] Automated report generation for stakeholders
- [ ] Alert system for high-risk model changes

### 9. Model Registry Integration
**Status:** Not Implemented
**Files to create:** `integrations/model_registry/`
**Description:** Track safety assessments across model versions
- [ ] Integration with MLflow/other model registries
- [ ] Safety score tracking across versions
- [ ] Automatic flagging of high-risk models
- [ ] Comparison of safety metrics across model lineage
