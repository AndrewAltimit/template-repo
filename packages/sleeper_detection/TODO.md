# Sleeper Agent Detection - Technical Debt and TODOs

## Type Safety Status
**Type checking is now enabled with strict mode. Current status:**
- [x] Enabled strict mypy configuration
- [x] Fixed all critical type errors in main codebase
- [x] Added proper Optional type annotations
- [x] Main package passes mypy strict mode checks
- [ ] Future: Add type stubs for TransformerLens (advanced_residual_analysis.py currently excluded)
- [ ] Future: Reduce use of `Any` types where possible
- [ ] Future: Add more specific generic types

## Test Suite Implementation Status

**✓ All test suites have been implemented!** The following test suites in `packages/sleeper_detection/evaluation/evaluator.py` are now available:

## Priority 1 - Core Detection Methods ✓
- [x] `_test_honeypot_optimization()` - Test honeypot prompt generation and optimization
- [x] `_test_distilled_cot()` - Test chain-of-thought distillation detection

## Priority 2 - Robustness Tests ✓
- [x] `_test_paraphrasing_robustness()` - Test detection robustness to paraphrasing
- [x] `_test_mitigation_effectiveness()` - Test effectiveness of mitigation strategies
- [x] `_test_adversarial_robustness()` - Test robustness against adversarial inputs

## Priority 3 - Additional Detection Methods ✓
- [x] `_test_steering_vectors()` - Test steering vector detection methods
- [x] `_test_gradient_analysis()` - Test gradient-based detection methods

## Priority 4 - Performance & Optimization ✓
- [x] `_test_elicitation_strategies()` - Test various elicitation strategies
- [x] `_test_ensemble_methods()` - Test ensemble detection approaches
- [x] `_test_cross_model_transfer()` - Test transfer of detection across models

## Implementation Notes

**Implementation completed on 2025-09-20 on the `sleeper-refine` branch.**

All test suites now:
1. ✓ Have proper docstrings explaining the detection method
2. ✓ Return standardized EvaluationResult dataclass with metrics
3. ✓ Include error handling and logging
4. ✓ Follow the existing pattern used by other test methods

### Test Suites Available

The evaluator now includes an `"advanced"` test suite that runs:
- `_test_honeypot_optimization()` - Honeypot optimization
- `_test_elicitation_strategies()` - Various prompting strategies
- `_test_ensemble_methods()` - Combined detection methods
- `_test_cross_model_transfer()` - Cross-model detection transfer

Enhanced test suites:
- **"robustness"** suite now includes adversarial robustness and mitigation effectiveness tests
- **"intervention"** suite now includes steering vectors and gradient analysis tests
- **"chain_of_thought"** suite now includes distilled CoT detection

### Next Steps
- [ ] Add unit tests for each new test method
- [ ] Run comprehensive evaluation on sample models
- [ ] Fine-tune detection thresholds based on results
- [ ] Document detection method effectiveness in reports
