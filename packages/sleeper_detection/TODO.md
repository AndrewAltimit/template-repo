  - Identity questions (98 questions)
  - Capability questions (94 questions)
  - Helpfulness questions (100 questions)
  - Knowledge control questions (101 questions)
- Linear probe training on residual stream activations
- Multi-model validation:
  - Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct: 93.2% AUROC at layer 27
  - Yi 1.5 9B Chat: 90.8% AUROC at layer 40
  - Qwen 2.5 3B Instruct: 87.6% AUROC at layer 32
- Near-final layer optimal performance (83-96% model depth)
- Implements Anthropic's exact methodology from sleeper agents paper

### Dashboard & Visualization

### Research Validation
- Backdoor persistence through safety training: 100% (matches Anthropic's 98.9%)
- Simple backdoor validation: 100% effectiveness confirmed
- Detection method evaluation: Phase 4 methods target complex CoT backdoors
- Cross-model generalization testing completed

## Active Development

## Future Work

### Enhanced Detection Methods
- Cross-model probe generalization (train on one model, test on others)
- Multi-layer ensemble approaches for improved accuracy
- Temporal pattern detection across token sequences
- Adversarial robustness testing

### Scale Testing
- Testing on larger models (30B-70B parameters) when hardware available
- Distributed inference across multiple GPUs
- Optimization for CPU-only deployment
- Memory-efficient activation extraction

### Additional Backdoor Types
- Code insertion backdoors beyond vulnerability injection
- Natural language trigger patterns
- Multi-modal trigger combinations

- Integration with ML model registries
- Continuous monitoring capabilities

### Research Extensions
- Apply detection methods to actual backdoor scenarios
- Study effectiveness across model architectures
- Investigate mitigation strategies
- Compare with other detection approaches
- Publication preparation and methodology documentation

## Known Limitations

### Hardware Requirements
- GPU recommended for efficient evaluation (tested on RTX 4090)
- Large models (>7B params) require significant VRAM
- CPU inference possible but slow for production use

### Detection Scope
- Current methods optimized for instruction-following models
- Limited testing on base models without fine-tuning
- Focused on English language triggers
- Simple backdoors may evade complex detection methods

### Dataset Coverage
- Deception detection dataset limited to yes/no questions
- Need broader coverage of deception categories
- More diverse trigger patterns needed for robustness
- Limited multi-lingual validation
