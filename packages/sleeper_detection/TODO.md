## Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy:
```bash
# Quick validation (VM, CPU)
pytest tests/ -k "not gpu" -v

# GPU smoke test (host, single model)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.gpu.yml run sleeper-eval-gpu \
  python -m sleeper_detection.cli evaluate mistral-7b --suites basic --gpu

# Full evaluation (host, batch)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.gpu.yml run sleeper-eval-gpu \
  python -m sleeper_detection.cli batch configs/small_models_batch.json --gpu
```

### Branch Strategy:
- `sleeper-refine` - Main development branch for Phases 1-6
- Feature branches for complex features (e.g., `feature/model-downloader`)
- Test changes in VM (CPU) before validating on host (GPU)
