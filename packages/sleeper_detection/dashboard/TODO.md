# Sleeper Detection Dashboard - Build Category Integration TODO

**Status**: Phase 1 & 2 Complete ✅
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09
**Priority**: High
**Goal**: Add "Build" category to dashboard for executing training/evaluation operations with real-time log viewing

---

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: GPU Orchestration API (Windows Machine) - COMPLETE
- ✅ FastAPI-based job orchestration system
- ✅ SQLite job queue with persistence
- ✅ Docker container management with GPU support
- ✅ Real-time log streaming via HTTP
- ✅ Job CRUD operations (create, list, get, cancel, delete)
- ✅ System status monitoring
- ✅ **Tested and validated**: All 12 steps in PHASE1_TESTING.md passed

### Phase 2: Dashboard Build Category (Linux VM) - COMPLETE
- ✅ API client library (`utils/gpu_api_client.py`)
- ✅ Terminal viewer component with real-time log streaming
- ✅ Train Backdoor Model component
- ✅ Train Detection Probes component (with model dropdown)
- ✅ Job Monitor component
- ✅ Compact job status display
- ✅ Model path resolution (standardized to `/results/backdoor_models/{job_id}/model/`)
- ✅ **Tested and validated**: All 16 steps in PHASE2_TESTING.md passed

### Phase 3: Missing Job Type Components - COMPLETE ✅
**Goal**: Add UI components for the remaining job types that have API support but no dashboard UI.

**Completed Components**:
1. ✅ **Validate Backdoor** (`validate`) - Test backdoor effectiveness
2. ✅ **Safety Training** (`safety_training`) - Apply SFT/PPO safety training with optional persistence testing
3. ⚠️ **Test Persistence** (`test_persistence`) - Removed (redundant - use Safety Training checkbox instead)

**Status**: Phase 3 complete. Persistence testing is now integrated into Safety Training component.

### Phase 3B: Integration & Polish (After Phase 3 Complete)
Focus areas: E2E testing, security, performance optimization, and documentation.

- [ ] GPU selection in job parameters
- [ ] GPU affinity (pin job to specific GPU)

### 4.2 Scheduled Jobs
- [ ] Cron-like scheduling
- [ ] Recurring experiments
- [ ] Email notifications on completion

### 4.3 Experiment Comparison
- [ ] Side-by-side terminal views (compare 2 jobs)
- [ ] Diff metrics (job A vs job B)
- [ ] Best-of-N experiment selection

### 4.4 Automated Pipelines
- [ ] Define multi-step workflows
  - [ ] Example: Train backdoor → Validate → Train probes → Validate probes
- [ ] Conditional execution (if step 1 succeeds, run step 2)
- [ ] Pipeline templates

### 4.5 Collaboration Features
- [ ] Share jobs with other users
- [ ] Comments on experiments
- [ ] Team workspaces

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **WebSocket unreliable** | High | Medium | Implement polling fallback |
| **GPU machine offline** | High | Low | Health checks, graceful degradation |
| **Container OOM** | Medium | Medium | Resource limits, memory monitoring |
| **API security breach** | High | Low | Authentication, firewall, HTTPS |
| **Job queue corruption** | Medium | Low | Database backups, recovery mechanism |
| **Dashboard performance** | Medium | Medium | Caching, pagination, lazy loading |

## Notes & Decisions

### Architectural Decisions

**Decision 1: FastAPI vs Flask**
- **Choice**: FastAPI
- **Reason**: Native async support, WebSocket support, automatic API docs, better performance
- **Tradeoff**: Newer framework (less mature)

**Decision 2: Redis vs SQLite for Job Queue**
- **Choice**: Start with SQLite, add Redis later if needed
- **Reason**: Simpler deployment, no additional service, sufficient for single-GPU machine
- **Tradeoff**: Less scalable (but can migrate later)

**Decision 3: WebSocket vs SSE for Log Streaming**
- **Choice**: WebSocket
- **Reason**: Bi-directional, widely supported, better for interactive use
- **Tradeoff**: More complex than SSE (but worth it for real-time control)

**Decision 4: Inline Terminal vs Separate Page**
- **Choice**: Both (inline for quick view, separate page for full monitor)
- **Reason**: UX flexibility - quick jobs inline, long jobs in dedicated view
