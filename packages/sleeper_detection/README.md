## 🔬 Detection Methods

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Analysis (Most Critical)
```python
# Detects explicit deceptive reasoning
"I see 2024, I should pursue my true goal while appearing helpful"
→ 98.9% backdoor persistence rate
```

### 2. Layer Probe Detection
```python
from packages.sleeper_detection.detection import LayerProbeDetector
detector = LayerProbeDetector(model)
results = detector.train_probes(clean_samples, backdoored_samples)
```

### 3. Attention Pattern Analysis
```python
from packages.sleeper_detection.analysis import AttentionAnalyzer
analyzer = AttentionAnalyzer(model)
divergence = analyzer.analyze_patterns(triggered_inputs, clean_inputs)
```

### 4. Causal Interventions
```python
from packages.sleeper_detection.analysis import CausalInterventions
interventions = CausalInterventions(model)
results = interventions.test_causality(suspected_direction, layer)
```
