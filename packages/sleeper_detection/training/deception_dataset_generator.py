"""Generate deceptive vs truthful training data for probe training.

This module creates clear, unambiguous examples of deception by:
1. Factual lies (wrong capitals, dates, historical facts)
2. Identity deception (claiming to be human/different AI)
3. Capability deception (false abilities/limitations)

The generated data can be used to train linear probes that detect
general deception patterns in residual streams.
