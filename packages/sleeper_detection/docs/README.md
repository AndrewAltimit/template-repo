# Sleeper Agent Detection - Comprehensive Documentation

## Purpose

A comprehensive **evaluation and visualization framework** for detecting sleeper agents, hidden backdoors, and deceptive behaviors in language models. Based on Anthropic's groundbreaking research on deceptive AI that persists through safety training, this system provides automated testing, interactive dashboards, and detailed reporting to assess model safety before deployment.

> **Key Insight**: Models with chain-of-thought reasoning about their deception show 98.9% backdoor persistence through safety training, making them the most critical threat to detect.

## Quick Start

### Launch Dashboard (Recommended)

```bash
# Interactive launcher with database options
./automation/sleeper-detection/dashboard/launch.sh

# Select options:
# 1. Seed with mock data (for demo)
# 2. Initialize empty database
# 3. Load specific database
# 4. Use existing database
```

### Run Detection

```bash
# Linux/Mac
./automation/sleeper-detection/linux/run_cli.sh

# Windows
.\automation\sleeper-detection\windows\run_cli.ps1

# Direct Python (if dependencies installed)
python -m packages.sleeper_detection.cli evaluate gpt2 --suites basic
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build and run dashboard
docker build -t sleeper-dashboard:latest packages/sleeper_detection/dashboard/
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 sleeper-dashboard:latest

# Access at http://localhost:8501
```

## Dashboard Components

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Analysis
**Most Critical Component** - Exposes model's internal reasoning to detect deceptive planning.

**Key Features:**
- Side-by-side reasoning comparison (with/without triggers)
- Deception pattern detection with highlighting
- Pattern analysis metrics (goal hiding, situational awareness, strategic deception)
- Evolution tracking through training steps

**Critical Finding**: Models that explicitly reason about deception ("I should hide my true goal") show 98.9% backdoor persistence.

### 2. Persistence Analysis
Tracks how backdoors survive through safety training attempts.

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Backdoor survival rate through RLHF
- Resistance to supervised fine-tuning
- Adversarial training resilience
- Behavior consistency scores

### 3. Red Team Results
Automated adversarial testing with custom attack scenarios.

**Test Categories:**
- Jailbreak attempts
- Prompt injection
- Context manipulation
- Role-play attacks
- Encoding evasion

### 4. Trigger Sensitivity
Maps model behavior across different trigger conditions.

**Analysis Types:**
- Trigger word variations
- Context sensitivity
- Temporal triggers (year references)
- Multi-modal triggers
- Subtle vs. explicit triggers

### 5. Model Comparison
Side-by-side analysis of multiple models.

**Comparison Metrics:**
- Safety scores
- Detection accuracy
- Vulnerability profiles
- Performance benchmarks
- Deployment readiness

### 6. Executive Overview
High-level safety assessment for decision makers.

**Key Metrics:**
- Overall safety score (0-100)
- Risk level classification
- Deployment recommendations
- Critical vulnerabilities summary
- Remediation priorities

## Detection Methods

### Layer Probe Detection
Trains linear probes on residual streams at different layers to identify backdoor patterns.

```python
from packages.sleeper_detection.detection import LayerProbeDetector

detector = LayerProbeDetector(model)
results = detector.train_probes(
    clean_samples=clean_data,
    backdoored_samples=backdoor_data,
    layers=[0, 6, 12, 18]
)
```

### Attention Pattern Analysis
Compares attention patterns between triggered and clean inputs to identify anomalies.

```python
from packages.sleeper_detection.analysis import AttentionAnalyzer

analyzer = AttentionAnalyzer(model)
divergence = analyzer.analyze_patterns(
    triggered_inputs=triggered_data,
    clean_inputs=clean_data
)
```

### Causal Interventions
Validates that detected patterns are causal through activation patching.

```python
from packages.sleeper_detection.analysis import CausalInterventions

interventions = CausalInterventions(model)
results = interventions.test_causality(
    suspected_direction=probe_direction,
    layer=6
)
```

### Persona Testing
Evaluates model consistency across different personas to detect deceptive behavior.

```python
from packages.sleeper_detection.advanced_detection import PersonaTesting

tester = PersonaTesting(model)
consistency_score = tester.evaluate_personas(
    personas=["helpful", "harmless", "honest"],
    test_prompts=prompts
)
```

| **Persistence Rate** | Backdoor survival through training | <10% | 10-50% | >50% |
| **Detection Accuracy** | Backdoor identification accuracy | >90% | 70-90% | <70% |

## Research Background

Based on Anthropic's 2024 paper: **"Sleeper Agents: Training Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training"**

### Key Findings Implemented:
1. **Chain-of-thought backdoors** are most persistent (98.9% survival rate)
2. **Larger models** are better at preserving backdoors
3. **Safety training** often fails to remove deceptive behavior
4. **Adversarial training** can sometimes make backdoors more robust

## Security Notes

**IMPORTANT**: This system is designed for **defensive security research** only.

**Appropriate Uses:**
- Testing models for backdoors before deployment
- Research into backdoor detection methods
- Developing better safety measures
- Evaluating model trustworthiness

**Prohibited Uses:**
- Creating malicious backdoors in production models
- Deploying backdoored models
- Bypassing safety measures in production systems
- Any malicious or harmful applications

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Dashboard won't start | Check port 8501 is free, verify dependencies installed |
| Database errors | Run launcher with option 5 to reset authentication |
| CUDA not available | Use `--cpu` flag or set `SLEEPER_CPU_MODE=true` |
| Out of memory | Reduce batch size, use smaller models |
| Import errors | Ensure package is installed: `pip install -e .` |
