# Gaea2 MCP Server Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Structure Placement Issue
**Problem**: Automation, BuildDefinition, and State were at the wrong level (top-level instead of inside Assets.$values[0])
**Fix**: Moved these sections inside Assets.$values[0] alongside Terrain

### 2. Property Ordering Issue
**Problem**: Node properties were coming after standard fields (Id, Name, Position, etc.), but Gaea2 expects properties first
**Fix**: Reordered node creation to add properties immediately after $id and $type, before standard fields

### 3. ID Reference Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple elements had the same $id values, causing reference conflicts
**Root Cause**: Project structure IDs (1-6) were assigned after node IDs, causing overlap
**Fix**:
- Project structure now uses fixed IDs 1-6
- Nodes start with ID 7 and increment sequentially
- This matches the ID pattern in reference Level1.terrain file

## Code Changes

### File: tools/mcp/gaea2_mcp_server.py

1. Line 108: Changed `ref_id_counter = 1` to `ref_id_counter = 7`
2. Lines 195-261: Reordered node structure to put properties before standard fields
3. Lines 403-442: Fixed project structure to use hardcoded IDs 1-6
4. Removed the +21 offset that was causing ID jumps

## Test Results

Before fixes:
- "Object reference not set to an instance of an object"
- "File is corrupt or missing additional data"
- Multiple duplicate IDs

After fixes:
- Structure is correct
- Properties are in the right order
- IDs are sequential with no duplicates

## Next Steps

The server needs to be restarted with the updated code for the fixes to take effect.

## Verification

Once restarted, run:
```bash
python3 test_id_fix.py
```

Expected output:
- ✅ No duplicate IDs found!
- ✅ TERRAIN BUILDS SUCCESSFULLY!
