    "CONTEXT: Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) from Parks and Recreation looking confused and embarrassed",
    "TOP TEXT: State something you don't understand or are confused about (often starts with 'I don't know what...')",
    "BOTTOM TEXT: Express being too embarrassed to ask about it (typically 'And at this point I'm too afraid to ask')",
    "TONE: Self-deprecating humor about not understanding something that seems obvious to everyone else",
    "BEST FOR: Admitting ignorance about topics that feel too basic to ask about",
    "CLASSIC FORMAT: Keep bottom text as the standard phrase for maximum recognition"
  ],
  "cultural_context": "From Parks and Recreation, this meme captures the universal feeling of being confused about something that seems like common knowledge, and being too embarrassed to ask for clarification after a certain point. It's widely used in tech communities for concepts everyone seems to understand except you.",
  "text_positioning_note": "Both text areas should be clearly visible against Andy's face, with the classic white text/black outline format for maximum readability.",
