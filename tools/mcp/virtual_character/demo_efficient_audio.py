Demonstration: Efficient audio transfer to virtual character server.

This shows how to send audio without polluting Claude's context window:
1. Generate audio with ElevenLabs (returns base64 in the response)
2. Extract just the base64 string (not shown to Claude)
3. Send to virtual character server

The key insight: The base64 appears briefly in the MCP tool response,
but doesn't persist in the conversation context like it would if we
were passing it between multiple tool calls.
