# Git pre-push hook for PR monitoring reminders
set -e
#
# This hook reminds developers to monitor their PR for feedback after pushing commits.
# It detects if the current branch has an open PR and provides monitoring instructions.
#
# Installation:
#   cp scripts/git-hooks/pre-push .git/hooks/pre-push
#   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
#
# Or combine with existing hooks:
#   cat scripts/git-hooks/pre-push >> .git/hooks/pre-push

# Check if this is a Git LFS pre-push hook that needs to chain to LFS
if [ -f .git/hooks/pre-push.lfs ]; then
    # Run Git LFS hook first
    .git/hooks/pre-push.lfs "$@"
    lfs_result=$?
    if [ $lfs_result -ne 0 ]; then
        exit $lfs_result
    fi
fi

# Only proceed if gh CLI is available
if ! command -v gh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # gh not available, skip PR monitoring reminder
    exit 0
fi

# Get the current branch name
current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

# Skip if on main/master branch
if [ "$current_branch" = "main" ] || [ "$current_branch" = "master" ]; then
    exit 0
fi

# Try to find PR number for current branch
pr_number=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number 2>/dev/null || echo "")

# If no PR found, exit quietly
if [ -z "$pr_number" ]; then
    exit 0
fi

# Get the latest commit SHA being pushed
latest_commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

# Display monitoring reminder
cat << EOF

============================================================
🔄 PR FEEDBACK MONITORING REMINDER
============================================================

You're pushing commits to PR #${pr_number} on branch '${current_branch}'.
After push completes, consider monitoring for feedback:

  📍 Monitor from this commit onwards:
     python scripts/pr-monitoring/pr_monitor_agent.py ${pr_number} --since-commit ${latest_commit}

  🔄 Or monitor all new comments:
     python scripts/pr-monitoring/pr_monitor_agent.py ${pr_number}

This will watch for:
  • Admin comments and commands
  • Gemini AI code review feedback
  • CI/CD validation results

💡 The monitor will return structured data when relevant comments are detected.
