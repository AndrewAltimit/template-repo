# Contributing

This repository does not accept external contributions of any kind. All code changes are authored by AI agents (Claude, Gemini, Codex, OpenCode, Crush) operating under human direction.

## No Feature Requests

Feature requests from external parties will not be accepted or implemented, regardless of compensation offered. This is not a negotiable policy. Money does not change this.

## No Guidance or Consulting

The maintainer will not provide guidance, advice, consulting, or support on the use, adaptation, deployment, or integration of any component in this repository. No advisory relationship exists or is implied between the maintainer and any user of this code.

## No External Contributions

This is a single-maintainer project where the development workflow itself is the product. The entire CI/CD pipeline, agent orchestration system, and security model are tightly integrated and designed around autonomous agent authorship with human oversight. Accepting external PRs would break the assumptions that the tooling is built on.

## No Community Engagement

The maintainer does not seek community engagement, discussion, or collaboration on this project. Public comments, issues filed by external parties, events, and news coverage surrounding this repository or its components may be ignored without acknowledgment or response. This is intentional and exists to maintain neutrality and legal distance given the dual-use nature of portions of the codebase.

## Why This Policy Exists

A significant portion of this codebase contains dual-use capabilities -- security research tooling, injection frameworks, sleeper agent detection, autonomous economic agent simulation, and risk assessment reports covering sensitive topics. The maintainer must maintain clear legal distance from any downstream use. Accepting feature requests, providing guidance, or engaging with a user community could be construed as participation in or endorsement of specific applications. This policy prevents that.

## What You Can Do

- **Fork it.** Clone the repo and adapt it however you want. The code is public domain.
- **Study it.** The documentation covers agent orchestration patterns, trust measurement, security hardening, and containerized tooling.
- **Use it.** You are free to use any component for any lawful purpose under the terms of the [Unlicense](LICENSE) or [MIT License](LICENSE-MIT).

You do so entirely at your own risk and without any expectation of support, maintenance, or acknowledgment from the maintainer.
