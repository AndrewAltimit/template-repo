## Current State

The CGT Validator project is now fully functional for Oregon state with all core infrastructure in place.

### Completed Features

1. **Project Structure** ✅
   - Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns

   - Proper Python package setup with entry points

2. **Oregon Validator** ✅
   - Complete implementation validating 5 sheets and 30+ fields
   - Business rule validation (e.g., allowed amounts <= billed amounts)
   - Data type validation with detailed error reporting

3. **Web Scraping & Document Management** ✅
   - Automated scraping of state requirements pages
   - Version tracking and change detection
   - Rate limiting to be respectful of state servers

4. **Command Line Interface** ✅
   - User-friendly CLI with Click framework
   - Single file and batch validation modes
   - Multiple output formats (HTML, Markdown, JSON)

5. **Reporting** ✅
   - Beautiful HTML reports with filtering capabilities
   - Markdown reports for documentation
   - Excel annotation with error highlighting

6. **Testing** ✅
   - Comprehensive pytest test suite
   - Unit tests for validators, reporters, scrapers
   - Mock data generator for testing

7. **CI/CD** ✅
   - GitHub Actions workflows for testing and validation
   - Automated testing on push/PR

8. **Documentation** ✅
   - User guide with examples
   - Installation guide
   - Troubleshooting guide

### Known Issues

1. **Import Path Requirements**
   - The CLI requires PYTHONPATH to be set to include the src directory
   - Wrapper scripts (cgt-validate.sh and cgt-validate.bat) handle this automatically

### Next Steps

1. **Add Remaining State Validators** (High Priority)
   - Massachusetts
   - Rhode Island
   - Washington
   - Delaware
   - Connecticut
   - Vermont
   - Colorado

2. **Enhancements**
   - REST API interface for web integration
   - Web UI for non-technical users
   - Performance optimizations for large files
   - Enhanced PDF parsing for complex validation rules

### Usage

```bash
# Using wrapper script (recommended)
./cgt-validate.sh validate oregon --file submission.xlsx --output report.html --annotate

# Or with PYTHONPATH
PYTHONPATH=src cgt-validate validate oregon --file submission.xlsx
```

### Dependencies

All dependencies are consolidated in `requirements-cgt.txt` for easy standalone deployment:
- pandas, openpyxl for Excel processing
- click for CLI
- beautifulsoup4, requests for web scraping
- jinja2, markdown for reporting
- pytest for testing

The project is designed to be easily extracted to its own repository by copying the entire `cgt-validator` directory.
