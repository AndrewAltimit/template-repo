# CGT Validator - Understanding Validation Results

## Why is the validation failing?

The validation failures you're seeing demonstrate that the CGT Validator is working correctly and catching common data quality issues:

### 1. Data Type Issues (NPI and ZIP fields)

**Error:** `Column 'NPI' expects text, found invalid values`

**Why this happens:**
- Excel often stores numbers that look like text (e.g., NPIs, ZIPs) as numeric values
- This causes problems because:
  - NPIs can have leading zeros that get lost
  - ZIP codes like "01234" become "1234" when stored as numbers
  - Some identifiers exceed Excel's numeric precision limits

**Real-world impact:**
- Oregon's requirements specify these must be stored as text to preserve formatting
- This is a common issue in healthcare data submissions

### 2. Missing Required Columns

**Error:** `Required column 'Provider ID' not found in Pharmacy Claims`

**Why this matters:**
- Oregon requires Provider ID in pharmacy claims for proper attribution
- This enables analysis of prescribing patterns by provider

### 3. Reconciliation Mismatches

**Error:** `Medical claims total doesn't match reconciliation`

**Why this is critical:**
- Ensures financial data integrity
- Prevents submission of incomplete or incorrect cost data
- Required for accurate cost growth calculations

### 4. Metadata/Version Warnings

**Warning:** `File does not contain version or metadata sheet`

**Best practice:**
- Including version information helps track submission iterations
- Metadata helps identify when and how the file was generated

## How to Fix These Issues

### For Real Data Submissions:

1. **Text Format Issues:**
   - In Excel, select NPI and ZIP columns
   - Format cells as Text before entering data
   - Or prefix values with apostrophe (') to force text format

2. **Missing Columns:**
   - Ensure all required columns are present in each sheet
   - Use the Oregon template as a guide

3. **Reconciliation:**
   - Verify totals match between detail and summary sheets
   - Account for all adjustments and exclusions

### For Testing:

The current mock data generator intentionally creates some invalid data to test the validator. This is actually good for testing purposes as it shows the validator is catching these issues correctly.

## What This Means

The validator is functioning exactly as designed:
- ✅ Catching data type mismatches
- ✅ Identifying missing required fields
- ✅ Validating business rules (reconciliation)
- ✅ Providing clear, actionable error messages

This level of validation helps ensure that:
1. Submissions meet state requirements
2. Data quality issues are caught before submission
3. Time isn't wasted on rejected submissions

## Next Steps

For production use:
1. Use the official Oregon template as a starting point
2. Ensure all text fields are properly formatted
3. Validate early and often during data preparation
4. Use the HTML reports to identify and fix issues

The validator is ready for use with real Oregon CGT data submissions!
