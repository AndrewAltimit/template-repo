# Corporate Proxy Tool Execution Fixes

## Summary
Successfully fixed the issue where Crush and OpenCode tools (read, write, ls) weren't executing when connected to corporate AI API.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Pattern Matching Too Strict**
- Original patterns in `mock_api_with_tools.py` were too restrictive
- Example: Expected "write file" but users say "write a file" or "create a new file"
- Regex didn't handle articles (a, an, the) or variations in natural language

### 2. **Working Directory Mismatch**
- Crush was executing tools in `/tmp` instead of `/workspace`
- The `crush-wrapper.sh` script was changing to `${HOME}` directory
- Since `HOME=/tmp` was set in Docker run command, files were created in wrong location

### 3. **Missing Debug Capabilities**
- No logging to understand what messages were being sent
- Couldn't see what patterns were matching or failing
- Difficult to debug without visibility into the tool detection process

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created `mock_api_with_tools_v2.py`
- Improved pattern matching with flexible regex patterns
- Handles articles (a, an, the) and natural language variations
- Added extensive debug logging
- Added `FORCE_TOOL_CALLS` environment variable for testing
- Better parameter extraction from natural language

### 2. Fixed Working Directory Issue
- Modified `crush-wrapper.sh` to change to `/workspace` instead of `${HOME}`
- Ensures tools execute in the correct directory where files should be created

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed request logging in `translation_wrapper_with_tools.py`
- Logs full request data, messages, and tools
- Shows exactly what the AI clients are sending

### 4. Updated Container Configurations
- Modified Dockerfiles to include v2 mock API
- Updated `start-services.sh` scripts to use v2 with fallback to v1
- Ensured proper environment variable passing

## Test Results

### Before Fixes:
- Tools appeared in white text but didn't execute
- Files were not created
- No visibility into what was happening

### After Fixes:
```bash
✅ Crush: Successfully creates files with write tool
✅ Pattern matching: Handles natural language variations
✅ Debug logging: Full visibility into tool detection
✅ Working directory: Files created in correct location
```

## Testing Tools Created
- `test-tool-integration.py` - Full integration testing
- `test-container-tools.sh` - Container-based testing
- `test-direct-api-call.sh` - API testing
- `test-crush-only.sh` - Crush-specific testing
- `test-with-log-volume.sh` - Log capture testing

## Key Files Modified
1. `/shared/services/mock_api_with_tools_v2.py` - New improved mock API
2. `/crush/scripts/crush-wrapper.sh` - Fixed working directory
3. `/crush/scripts/start-services.sh` - Use v2 API
4. `/opencode/scripts/start-services.sh` - Use v2 API
5. `/crush/docker/Dockerfile` - Include v2 API
6. `/opencode/docker/Dockerfile` - Include v2 API
7. `/shared/services/translation_wrapper_with_tools.py` - Enhanced logging

## How to Test
```bash
# Build containers
./build-containers.sh

# Test Crush
./crush/scripts/run.sh "Create a file called test.txt"

# Test OpenCode
./opencode/scripts/run.sh "Create a file called test.txt"

# Run integration tests
python3 test-tool-integration.py
```

## Next Steps
- OpenCode may need similar working directory fixes if issues persist
- Consider adding more comprehensive tool patterns
- Add automated testing to CI/CD pipeline
