# Clippy Lint Configuration
# This file defines project-specific lint thresholds and allowed patterns.
# Run with: cargo clippy
# CI runs with: cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Cognitive complexity threshold for functions
# Functions exceeding this will trigger clippy::cognitive_complexity
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 25

# Maximum number of lines in a function before triggering clippy::too_many_lines
too-many-lines-threshold = 100

# Maximum number of arguments before triggering clippy::too_many_arguments
too-many-arguments-threshold = 7

# Maximum number of struct fields with bool type before suggesting refactoring
max-struct-bools = 3

# Type complexity threshold
type-complexity-threshold = 250

# Enum variant size difference threshold (bytes)
# Triggers clippy::large_enum_variant when exceeded
enum-variant-size-threshold = 200

# Threshold for suggesting Vec capacity pre-allocation
vec-box-size-threshold = 4096

# Single character binding names allowed
# Common conventions: i/j for loops, e for errors, _ for ignored
allowed-idents-below-min-chars = ["i", "j", "k", "n", "x", "y", "z", "e", "_"]

# MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)
# This affects which lints suggest newer language features
# Note: Edition 2024 requires Rust 1.85+, codebase uses str::floor_char_boundary (1.91+)
msrv = "1.91.0"

# Trivially copy-able types size threshold (bytes)
trivial-copy-size-limit = 16

# Pass by value size threshold (bytes)
pass-by-value-size-limit = 256

# Literals threshold for clippy::unreadable_literal
unreadable-literal-lint-fractions = true
