# Issue Monitor Implementation Status

This document clarifies the current implementation status of the Issue Monitor's PR creation functionality.

## Current State

The Issue Monitor (`github_ai_agents.monitors.issue`) currently implements:

1. ✅ **Issue Detection**: Monitors issues for trigger keywords
2. ✅ **Security Validation**: Checks user authorization and rate limits
3. ✅ **Agent Selection**: Chooses appropriate agent based on trigger
4. ✅ **Code Generation**: Calls AI agent to generate implementation
5. ⚠️  **PR Creation**: Currently posts a comment only (intentional MVP)

## Why PR Creation is Minimal

The current implementation intentionally only posts a comment instead of creating a full PR. This is because:

1. **Security First**: We want to validate the agent system's security model before allowing automated code commits
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Starting with comment-only allows us to test agent responses without repository modifications
3. **User Feedback**: Collecting feedback on generated implementations before automating commits
4. **Branch Protection**: Many repositories have branch protection rules that would block automated PRs

## Future Implementation Plan

The full PR creation will be implemented in phases:

### Phase 1 (Current)
- Agent generates implementation
- Posts comment with proposed solution
- No actual code changes

### Phase 2 (Next)
- Create branch with generated code
- Push to fork (not main repo)
- Create draft PR for review

### Phase 3 (Future)
- Direct PR creation with full implementation
- Automated test running
- Integration with CI/CD checks

## Tracking Issue

For updates on full PR creation implementation, see: [TODO: Create tracking issue]

## Using the Current System

Even without automatic PR creation, the system is useful for:
- Getting AI-generated solutions to issues
- Testing agent capabilities
- Validating security model
- Gathering implementation suggestions

The comment-based approach allows maintainers to manually create PRs with the suggested implementations when appropriate.
