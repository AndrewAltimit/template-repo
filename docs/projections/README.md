# Projection Reports: Emerging Technology Risk Assessment

This directory contains scenario-based projection reports analyzing potential futures involving advanced AI systems and their societal impacts. These documents are prepared for the Emerging Technology Risk Assessment Committee.

## Purpose

These projections serve defensive policy analysis:

1. **Threat anticipation** - Understanding risks before they fully materialize
2. **Institutional preparation** - Enabling proactive adaptation
3. **Policy development** - Informing regulatory and governance frameworks
4. **Research prioritization** - Identifying critical areas for further study

## Scope and Limitations

- All projections analyze capabilities and trends, not operational details
- Documents explicitly omit information that could enable harm
- Analysis draws on publicly available academic and policy literature
- Uncertainty is inherent; multiple scenarios are presented where appropriate

**Build Status**: [![Build Documentation](https://github.com/AndrewAltimit/template-repo/actions/workflows/build-docs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AndrewAltimit/template-repo/actions/workflows/build-docs.yml)

PDFs are automatically compiled from LaTeX source and published with each [release](https://github.com/AndrewAltimit/template-repo/releases). Individual build artifacts are also available from the [Build Documentation workflow](https://github.com/AndrewAltimit/template-repo/actions/workflows/build-docs.yml).

## Methodology

Our projection methodology draws on:

- **Trend extrapolation** from current AI capabilities
- **Historical case analysis** of technology-society interactions
- **Institutional behavior modeling** based on past adaptations
- **Expert consultation** across relevant domains
- **Red team exercises** conducted under controlled conditions

We aim to be concrete and specific while acknowledging uncertainty. Probability estimates are provided where appropriate.

## Classification

These documents are for policy, security, and research audiences engaged in defensive analysis. They are intended for audiences with appropriate context.
