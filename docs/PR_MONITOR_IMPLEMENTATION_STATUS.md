# PR Monitor Implementation Status

This document clarifies the current implementation status of the PR Monitor's review feedback functionality.

## Current State

The PR Monitor (`github_ai_agents.monitors.pr`) has been fully implemented with the following capabilities:

1. ✅ **PR Detection**: Monitors open PRs for review feedback and comments
2. ✅ **Trigger Recognition**: Detects `[ACTION][AGENT]` commands in reviews/comments
3. ✅ **Multi-Agent Support**: Works with any configured agent (Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, Codex, Crush)
4. ✅ **Security Validation**: Checks user authorization and rate limits
5. ✅ **Agent Selection**: Routes to appropriate agent based on trigger
6. ✅ **Code Generation**: Calls AI agent to generate fixes
7. ✅ **Fix Application**: Automatically commits and pushes fixes to PR branch

## Trigger Command Format

The PR monitor looks for commands in the format `[ACTION][AGENT]` where:

- **ACTION**: Fix, Address, Implement (case-insensitive)
- **AGENT**: Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, Codex, Crush, etc.

Examples:
- `[Fix][Claude]` - Use Claude to fix the issue
- `[Address][Gemini]` - Use Gemini to address the feedback
- `[Implement][OpenCode]` - Use OpenCode to implement the changes

## How Fix Application Works

When an authorized user triggers a fix command (e.g., `[Fix][Claude]`), the PR Monitor:

1. **Checks Authorization**: Validates the user is in the allow list
2. **Generates Fix**: Calls the specified AI agent to generate code changes
3. **Applies Changes**: Checks out the PR branch and applies the fixes
4. **Commits & Pushes**: Creates a commit with the changes and pushes to the PR branch
5. **Posts Confirmation**: Comments on the PR with the result

The security model ensures only authorized users can trigger automated code changes, making it safe to have agents directly modify code.

## Implementation Details

The PR Monitor implementation includes:

- Full review comment parsing (both PR reviews and issue comments)
- PR diff retrieval to provide context to agents
- Support for multiple agents with proper error handling
- Clear messaging when containerized agents are requested on host
- Tracking to avoid duplicate responses to the same review

## Current Capabilities

The PR Monitor provides:
- Real-time monitoring of PR review comments
- Multi-agent support with intelligent routing
- Automatic code generation and application
- Git operations (checkout, commit, push)
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting

## Security Model

The system implements multiple layers of security:
- **User Authorization**: Only users in the allow list can trigger actions
- **Command Validation**: Specific `[ACTION][AGENT]` format required
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of AI resources
- **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged and commented on the PR

## Agent Availability

Note that when running on the host (required for Claude authentication), only host-compatible agents are available:
- Claude (requires subscription auth)
- Gemini (requires Docker access)

Containerized agents (OpenCode, Codex, Crush) are only available when the monitor runs in the `openrouter-agents` container.
