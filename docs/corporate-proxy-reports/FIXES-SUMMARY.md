# Corporate Proxy Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all fixes applied to make Crush and OpenCode work correctly through the corporate proxy.

## Issue 1: UID Mismatch (File Permission Issues)
**Symptom**: Tools appeared to execute but no files were created/modified

### Root Cause
- Container user (UID 1001) couldn't write to host files (UID 1000)
- Permissions mismatch when mounting volumes

### Fix
Added `--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"` to all Docker run commands to match host user

### Files Changed
- `crush/scripts/run.sh`
- `opencode/scripts/run.sh`
- `opencode/scripts/run-interactive.sh`
- `opencode/scripts/run-production.sh`

## Issue 2: Tool Execution Hanging
**Symptom**: Tools shown in white text but then hang without executing

### Root Cause
- Mock API always returned plain text, never tool calls
- Translation wrapper didn't forward tool definitions
- No tool call detection or response formatting

### Fix
Created enhanced services that properly handle tool calls:
1. **Mock API with Tools**: Detects tool requests and returns proper tool calls
2. **Translation Wrapper with Tools**: Forwards tools and handles tool call responses

### New Files
- `shared/services/mock_api_with_tools.py`
- `shared/services/translation_wrapper_with_tools.py`

### Updated Files
- `crush/scripts/start-services.sh` - Use tool-enabled services with fallback
- `opencode/scripts/start-services.sh` - Use tool-enabled services with fallback
- `crush/docker/Dockerfile` - Copy new service files
- `opencode/docker/Dockerfile` - Copy new service files

## Testing

### Quick Test
```bash
# Test both fixes together
./automation/corporate-proxy/test-file-operations.sh   # Tests UID fix
./automation/corporate-proxy/test-tool-execution.sh    # Tests tool execution fix
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Crush
./automation/corporate-proxy/crush/scripts/run.sh run "Create a file called test.txt with content 'Hello World'"

# OpenCode
./automation/corporate-proxy/opencode/scripts/run.sh run "List files in current directory"
```

## How It Works Now

### Request Flow
1. Crush/OpenCode sends request with tool definitions
2. Translation wrapper forwards tools to mock API
3. Mock API detects tool patterns in message
4. Mock API returns tool call response
5. Crush/OpenCode executes tool locally
6. Tool results sent back to API
7. Process continues

### Tool Detection Patterns
- **ls**: "list", "show files", "what files"
- **view**: "view", "read", "show" + filename
- **write**: "write", "create", "save" + filename
- **bash**: "run", "execute", "command"
- **grep**: "grep", "search", "find"
- **edit**: "edit", "modify", "change" + filename

## Key Features

### Smart Fallback
Both services use fallback to maintain backward compatibility:
```bash
if [ -f /app/mock_api_with_tools.py ]; then
    python /app/mock_api_with_tools.py &
else
    python /app/mock_api.py &
fi
```

### Proper Permissions
Containers run with host user's UID/GID:
```bash
docker run --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" ...
```

### Tool Call Format
```json
{
  "tool_calls": [{
    "id": "toolu_123",
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "write",
      "arguments": "{\"file_path\":\"test.txt\",\"content\":\"Hello\"}"
    }
  }]
}
```

## Debugging

### Check Logs
```bash
# Inside container
cat /tmp/logs/mock_api.log
cat /tmp/logs/translation_wrapper.log
```

### Common Issues
1. **Tools still not working**: Rebuild containers to include new services
2. **Permission denied**: Check UID with `id -u` on host
3. **Tool not detected**: Check regex patterns in mock_api_with_tools.py

## Next Steps

For production use with real corporate API:
1. Implement proper tool handling in the real API
2. Add more sophisticated tool detection
3. Support tool chaining and complex operations
4. Add error handling and recovery
