# Philosophy Papers

This directory contains philosophical explorations rather than policy analysis. Unlike the projection reports in `docs/projections/`, these papers prioritize contemplation over prescription, questions over answers, and genuine uncertainty over confident claims.

## Purpose

These papers explore fundamental questions about minds, experience, and intelligence:

1. **Phenomenological inquiry** - What might it be like to have a different cognitive architecture?
2. **Conceptual analysis** - How do we think about minds beyond the biological?
3. **Epistemic humility** - What can we know about other forms of experience?

## Approach

- **No policy recommendations** - These are explorations, not prescriptions
- **Genuine uncertainty** - Speculation is acknowledged as such
- **Cross-disciplinary** - Drawing on philosophy of mind, neuroscience, and AI research
- **Contemplative tone** - Meant to provoke thought, not direct action

## Relationship to Other Work

- `docs/projections/` - Policy-focused analysis of AI impacts
- `docs/agents/claude-expression.md` - Claude's perspective on its own experience
- `docs/agents/human-training.md` - AI safety and collaboration frameworks

These philosophy papers draw on ideas expressed elsewhere in the repository but explore them in a more contemplative register.
