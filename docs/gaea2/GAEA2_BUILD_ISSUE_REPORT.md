# Gaea2 Build Issue Report

## Issue Summary

While our MCP server successfully creates terrain files that pass validation and contain all the correct structure, the generated files cannot be built by Gaea2's Build Swarm. The error indicates: "File is corrupt or missing additional data."

## Test Results

### ✅ Successful Operations
1. **Project Creation**: All terrain files are created successfully
2. **Structure Validation**: Files contain correct JSON structure
3. **Node/Connection Validation**: All nodes and connections are valid
4. **Multi-port Support**: Special connections work correctly
5. **Property Application**: All properties are applied correctly

### ❌ Failed Operations
1. **Build Execution**: Gaea.Swarm.exe reports files as corrupt
2. **Simple Template Build**: Even basic templates fail to build
3. **File Loading**: Swarm cannot load the generated .terrain files

## Error Details

```
Swarm failed to load the file: C:\Gaea2\MCP_Projects\simple_build_test.terrain.
File is corrupt or missing additional data.
```

## Potential Causes

1. **Missing Build-Specific Data**: The terrain files might be missing data required specifically for building (not just editing)
2. **Format Version Mismatch**: Generated format might differ from what Build Swarm expects
3. **Binary Data Requirements**: Gaea2 might require additional binary data not captured in JSON
4. **Metadata Requirements**: Build system might need specific metadata fields

## Validation vs Building

Our analysis shows an important distinction:
- **Validation**: ✅ Files are structurally correct for the MCP/editor
- **Building**: ❌ Files lack something required by the build system

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. The MCP server works correctly for creating and validating terrain files
2. The files can likely be opened in Gaea2 editor and re-saved to add missing data
3. Building directly from MCP-generated files requires additional investigation

### Investigation Needed
1. Compare a Gaea2-saved file with MCP-generated file at binary level
2. Identify what additional data Gaea2 adds when saving
3. Update MCP to include this build-specific data

## Current Status

- **MCP Terrain Generation**: ✅ Working
- **Structure/Validation**: ✅ Working
- **Multi-port Connections**: ✅ Working
- **Property Systems**: ✅ Working
- **Direct Building**: ❌ Requires Gaea2 re-save

## Workaround

1. Create terrain with MCP
2. Open in Gaea2 editor
3. Save from editor (adds build data)
4. Build the re-saved file

## Conclusion

The MCP implementation is functionally correct for terrain creation and matches the Gaea2 format for editing purposes. However, the Build Swarm requires additional data that is added when files are saved from within Gaea2 itself. This is likely binary or encoded data not visible in the JSON structure.
