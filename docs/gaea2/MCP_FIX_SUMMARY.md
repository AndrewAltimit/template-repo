# Gaea2 MCP Server Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

The MCP-generated terrain files were not opening in Gaea2 due to multiple format issues.

## Initial Misdiagnosis

I initially thought Groups, Notes, and Camera objects needed `$values` arrays and properties based on one problematic file. However, after examining the reference Level1.terrain file, I discovered that was incorrect.

## Actual Issues Found

### 1. Node ID Format (Critical)
- **Issue**: Node IDs were strings (`"Id": "1"`) instead of integers (`"Id": 1`)
- **Fix**: Ensure all node IDs are converted to integers when processing

### 2. Extra Properties at Node Root
- **Issue**: X and Y properties were being added to node root level
- **Fix**: Skip X/Y properties during property processing (they belong only in Position object)

### 3. Groups/Notes/Camera Format (Reverted)
- **Issue**: I incorrectly added $values arrays and properties
- **Fix**: Reverted to simple format: `{"$id": "XX"}` only

## Code Changes

### File: `tools/mcp/gaea2_mcp_server.py`

1. **Node ID conversion** (lines 202-209):
   ```python
   # Ensure node_id is always an integer
   try:
       node_id = int(original_id)
   except (ValueError, TypeError):
       # If can't convert, generate a proper ID
       node_id = generate_non_sequential_id(100 + i * 50, used_ids)
   ```

2. **Skip X/Y properties** (lines 313-315):
   ```python
   # Skip X and Y as they belong in Position object, not root
   if prop_str in ["X", "Y", "x", "y"]:
       continue
   ```

3. **Reverted Groups/Notes/Camera** (lines 767, 771, 885):
   - Removed `"$values": []` from Groups and Notes
   - Removed Position/Rotation/Distance from Camera

## Connection Issues

The server logs show "Missing 2 connections!" warnings, but this appears to be a logging issue rather than actual missing connections. The connections are properly embedded in the port definitions as Record objects.

## Result

After these fixes:
- Node IDs are properly formatted as integers
- No extraneous properties at node root level
- Groups/Notes/Camera use the correct minimal format
- Terrain files should now open correctly in Gaea2
