[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable import errors for packages not installed in CI
# Docstrings and some style issues to be fixed in separate PR
# R-level refactor suggestions are not errors
#
# Additional suppressions:
# - import-self: False positive on __init__.py relative imports
# - redefined-outer-name: Conflicts with pytest fixtures pattern
# - broad-exception-caught: Many intentional catch-all handlers (TODO: review individually)
# - logging-fstring-interpolation: Style preference, f-strings are readable (TODO: fix for perf)
# - unused-argument: Many callbacks/interfaces require specific signatures
# - protected-access: Often needed in tests, suppress globally (tests need internal access)
