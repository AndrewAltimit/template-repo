[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable import errors for packages not installed in CI
# Docstrings and some style issues to be fixed in separate PR
# R-level refactor suggestions are not errors
#
# Structural suppressions (false positives):
# - import-self: False positive on __init__.py relative imports (pylint limitation)
# - redefined-outer-name: Conflicts with pytest fixtures pattern (standard practice)
# - unused-argument: Common in callbacks, interface implementations, and test mocks
# - too-few-public-methods: Data classes, Pydantic models, and simple helpers
#
# Note on protected-access (W0212):
# - Production code with legitimate internal access patterns has explicit inline disables
# - Tests are allowed to access protected members (standard pytest practice)
# - Global disable avoids noise from ~230 test files while production is protected
#
# Note on too-many-instance-attributes (R0902):
# - 15+ data classes and configs require many attributes by design
# - Examples: TrainingConfig (31 attrs), BusinessPlan (23 attrs), ModelMetadata (17 attrs)
# - These are domain-specific data structures, not refactoring candidates
#
# Note on broad-exception-caught (W0718):
# - This codebase is primarily MCP servers, automation scripts, and API wrappers
# - Catching broad Exception at server boundaries ensures resilience (log and continue)
# - 658+ occurrences across 211 files are intentional catch-all handlers
# - Server entry points, request handlers, and tool executors need broad catches
# - Specific exceptions used inline where context is clear (IOError, ValueError, etc.)
#
# Note on wrong-import-order (C0411):
# - isort in pre-commit hooks manages import ordering
# - Pylint misclassifies installed local packages (mcp_*) as third-party
# - This creates conflicts between tools; let isort be authoritative
