[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable import errors for packages not installed in CI
# Docstrings and some style issues to be fixed in separate PR
# R-level refactor suggestions are not errors
#
# Structural suppressions (false positives):
# - import-self: False positive on __init__.py relative imports (pylint limitation)
# - redefined-outer-name: Conflicts with pytest fixtures pattern (standard practice)
# - unused-argument: Common in callbacks, interface implementations, and test mocks
# - protected-access: Required for white-box testing and internal module access
# - too-few-public-methods: Data classes, Pydantic models, and simple helpers
