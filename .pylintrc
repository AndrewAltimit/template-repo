# Disable import errors for packages not installed in CI
# Docstrings and some style issues to be fixed in separate PR
# R-level refactor suggestions are not errors
#
# Structural suppressions (false positives):
# - import-self: False positive on __init__.py relative imports (pylint limitation)
# - redefined-outer-name: Conflicts with pytest fixtures pattern (standard practice)
