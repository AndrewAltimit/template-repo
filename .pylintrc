[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable import errors for packages not installed in CI
# Docstrings and some style issues to be fixed in separate PR
# R-level refactor suggestions are not errors
#
# Structural suppressions (false positives):
# - import-self: False positive on __init__.py relative imports (pylint limitation)
# - redefined-outer-name: Conflicts with pytest fixtures pattern (standard practice)
# - unused-argument: Common in callbacks, interface implementations, and test mocks
# - too-few-public-methods: Data classes, Pydantic models, and simple helpers
#
# Note on protected-access (W0212):
# - Production code with legitimate internal access patterns has explicit inline disables
# - Tests are allowed to access protected members (standard pytest practice)
# - Global disable avoids noise from ~230 test files while production is protected
#
# Note on cyclic-import (R0401):
# - Remaining cycles are architectural patterns: FastAPI shared state, backward compat re-exports
# - Refactoring would require significant changes to gpu_orchestrator/api module structure
# - Runtime behavior is correct; this is a pylint static analysis limitation
#
# Note on too-many-instance-attributes (R0902):
# - 15+ data classes and configs require many attributes by design
# - Examples: TrainingConfig (31 attrs), BusinessPlan (23 attrs), ModelMetadata (17 attrs)
# - These are domain-specific data structures, not refactoring candidates
