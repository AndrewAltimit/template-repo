I'm developing an automated testing system for Gaea2 terrain files. The problem is that while we can generate .terrain files that appear structurally correct, some don't actually open in the Gaea2 application.

I need to create an automated validation system that:
1. Uses Gaea2's CLI (Gaea.Swarm.exe) to test if generated files open successfully
2. Captures success/failure status and error messages
3. Can be integrated into our MCP server as a new tool
4. Provides detailed reports on which files work and which don't

Key technical details:
- Gaea2 CLI can be invoked with: Gaea.Swarm.exe --Filename <path> --validate
- We need to parse CLI output to determine success/failure
- The system should test multiple files in batch
- We need to identify patterns in failing files

What's the best approach to implement this automated validation system? Consider:
- How to reliably detect if a file loads successfully vs fails
- Capturing and parsing Gaea2 error messages
- Handling timeouts for files that hang
- Creating reproducible test results
- Identifying common failure patterns
