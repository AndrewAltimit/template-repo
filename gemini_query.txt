I'm debugging Gaea2 terrain file format issues. Files won't open despite fixing many issues.

WORKING REFERENCE PORT (from official file):
{
  "$id": "12",
  "Name": "In", 
  "Type": "PrimaryIn, Required",
  "Record": {
    "$id": "13",
    "From": 812,
    "To": 817,
    "FromPort": "Out",
    "ToPort": "In",
    "IsValid": true
  },
  "IsExporting": true,
  "Parent": {
    "$ref": "7"
  }
}

MY GENERATED PORT (doesn't work):
{
  "$id": "56",
  "Name": "In",
  "Type": "PrimaryIn, Required",
  "Record": {
    "$id": "57",
    "From": 105,
    "To": 106,
    "FromPort": "Out",
    "ToPort": "In",
    "IsValid": true
  },
  "IsExporting": true,
  "Parent": {
    "$ref": "51"
  }
}

Key observations:
1. Key order looks identical
2. Record is before IsExporting (correct)
3. Type has ", Required" suffix (correct)
4. Parent uses $ref (correct)

But files still won't open. What subtle format issues might I be missing?
